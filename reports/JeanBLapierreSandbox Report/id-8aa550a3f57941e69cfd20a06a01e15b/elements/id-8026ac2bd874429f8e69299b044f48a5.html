While we address climate change &#8211;
While we fight COVID-19 and its consequences &#8211;
While we grow our economy for everyone &#8211;
We cannot turn away from other challenges.

Gun violence is on the rise in many of our biggest cities.

While investing in prevention and supporting the work of law enforcement, we must also continue to strengthen gun control.

The Government has taken important actions like introducing lifetime background checks.

The Government will now put forward measures like a mandatory buyback of banned assault-style weapons, and move forward with any province or territory that wants to ban handguns.

During the pandemic, we have also seen an unacceptable rise in violence against women and girls. 

The Government is committed to moving forward with a 10-year National Action Plan on gender-based violence, and will continue to support organizations providing critical services.

When someone in our country is targeted because of their gender, or who they love, or where they come from, the way they pray, the language they speak, or the colour of their skin, we are all diminished.

Everyone should be &#8211; and feel &#8211; safe.

The Government will continue combatting hate and racism, including with a renewed Anti-Racism Strategy.</div>
