1.	These are part of ongoing improvements to the program to make sure it continues to meet the government&#8217;s goals and objectives to support the Canadian economy and the employer community as well as protecting the TFWs and the program from abuse;
2.	Implementing the amendments to regulations, which are mandatory, in a timely manner will ensure that employers are being held to the commitments made and are being inspected against the new conditions starting in September 2022 and onwards; 
3.	Regulatory changes will protect the TFWs employed in Canada:
o	by ensuring they have access to emergency medical care paid by the employer before they become eligible by provincial health care system;
o	by ensuring they are given information on their rights in Canada before or the first day of work;
o	by ensuring they are provided a written employment contract so they are aware of the terms and conditions of their employment before or on the first day of work.
4.	Suspension of employer&#8217;s LMIA application assessment, when there is a reason to suspect that the employer may not be complying with certain conditions, will protect the TFWs from serious harm and it will stop the employer from employing new TFWs until the allegations are addressed. It also strengthens program integrity and protects the Canadian labour market and standards of living. </div>
