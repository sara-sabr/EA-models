The CSLP has been unable to resolve certain account access issues affecting users of its National Student Loan Services Centre (NSLSC) portal since the program on boarded to the credentials and ECAS in April 2018. There are three main problems facing its clients: 
&#8226;	At least 30,000 NSLSC accounts are now locked out, and that number increases each day. The causes for this include:
o	GCKey username and password credentials are being forgotten by clients, thus preventing successful NSLSC login and contributing to the increasing tally of account lockouts.
o	NSLSC security questions and answers are being forgotten by clients, thus preventing successful credential substitution, and sustaining the account lockout tally.
&#8226;	MSFAA (Master Student Financial Assistance Agreement) for identity verification, as enabled by the Finastra vendor, is constrained to a single-use activation. NSLSC requires consuming one activation upon initial registration of the student. 

Note: Although CSLP has determined this to be the root cause for the business problems defined in this requirements document, it is not feasible to change the Finastra solution; therefore, the corrective action must start with the ECAS product. 
&#8226;	PAC method (i.e., re-registering the NSLSC account using credential substitution) for identity verification is a capability currently unavailable to NSLSC. 

Note: The program (CSLP) is in the process of evaluating the use of PAC as an alternative identity validation channel. 
The consequences of these account access issues include:
&#8226;	Negatively affected CSLP reputation (due to limitations of IT-enabled services).
&#8226;	Inability of clients (i.e., students) to access student loan status, balance, services, etc.
&#8226;	Increased call volume managed by the R&amp;A and CSLP (NSLSC support) to manage these issues.
In response to these challenges, this SDIV-MVP2 CSLP initiative seeks to: 
Augment the ECAS component by integrating SDIV with the capability to substitute credentials on NSLSC accounts, which will enable affected students to unlock their accounts. 
The integration of SDIV as a service to CSLP in the NSLSC product would provide an alternate identity verification provider to support client credential substitution for the following scenario:
-	NSLSC account login credentials and/or security Q&amp;A&#8217;s are forgotten by the client user.
SDIV integrated within NSLSC (SDIV-MVP2 CSLP initiative) is consistent with BDM and ESDC transformational business needs in addition to addressing current operational needs with respect to regaining access to locked client accounts. Additionally, providing a rapid identity verification experience to users seeking to substitute their credentials. The SDIV-MVP2 CSLP solution will support service transformation across ESDC by providing a high-quality service experience which enables clients to access loan information and other services in a more timely and accessible manner.
As a result, ESDC must assess new and adaptive technologies that will allow CLSP to provide a feasible alternative to the identity verification option to all students who wish to re-register and access their NSLSC account.</div>
