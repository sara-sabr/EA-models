Customers will be registered to use the MSFT facility. They must have a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate that is cross-certified with the Government of Canada federal PKI bridge, as well as an active Internet connection to implement the service.
Government of Canada institutions (departments, agencies and Crown corporations) must encrypt human resources (HR) and financial data in accordance with the Operational Security Standard: Management of Information Technology Security (MITS). Use of the Government of Canada MSFT secure file transfer service supports MITS for the secure transfer of any file type and size up to and including the "Protected B" level at medium assurance for bi-directional file transfers between users, systems and applications. MSFT is mandatory for SSC and customers.
As per the Service Level Agreement with customers, each customer is ultimately responsible for ensuring their own security and privacy compliance through the identification, mitigation and acceptance of any residual risks. The customer ensures the application of appropriate security and privacy controls in their IM and IT activities and procedures.
The customer is responsible for their own Security Assessment and Accreditation (SA&amp;A) initiatives related to their environment and systems.
Moreover, customer departments are responsible for controlling authorization and need-to-know within their own systems and are further advised, for added assurance, to encrypt end-to-end their protected data as per the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Operational Security Standard: Management Standard: Management of Information Technology Security (MITS).</div>
