						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">This is a fight for Canadians today and Canada tomorrow. So we must never forget the values that make us who we are. The fourth and final foundation of the Government&#8217;s approach is defending Canadian values and ensuring they are lived experiences for everyone.
Canada is a place where we take care of each other. This has helped Canada weather the pandemic better than many other countries.
Canada must continue to stand up for the values that define this country, whether that&#8217;s welcoming newcomers, celebrating with pride the contributions of LGBTQ2 communities, or embracing two official languages. There is work still to be done, including on the road of reconciliation, and in addressing systemic racism.

RECONCILIATION
Throughout the pandemic, the Government has made it a priority to support Indigenous communities, which has helped contain the spread of COVID-19 and kept people safe. That is something the Government will continue to do.
The Government will walk the shared path of reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, and remain focused on implementing the commitments made in 2019.
However, the pandemic has shown that we need to keep moving forward even faster on a number of fronts including by:
&#8226; Expediting work to co-develop distinctions-based Indigenous health legislation with First Nations, Inuit, and the M&#233;tis Nation, and a distinctions-based mental health and wellness strategy;
&#8226; Accelerating work on the National Action Plan in response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls&#8217; Calls for Justice, as well as implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission&#8217;s Calls to Action;
&#8226; And continuing to close the infrastructure gap in Indigenous communities, working on a distinctions-basis with First Nations, Inuit, and the M&#233;tis Nation to accelerate the government&#8217;s 10-year commitment.
The Government will also:
&#8226; Make additional resiliency investments to meet the clean drinking water commitment in First Nations communities;
&#8226; And support additional capacity-building for First Nations, Inuit, and the M&#233;tis Nation.
The Government will move forward to introduce legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples before the end of this year.

ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC RACISM
For too many Canadians, systemic racism is a lived reality. We know that racism did not take a pause during the pandemic. On the contrary, COVID-19 has hit racialized Canadians especially hard.
Many people &#8211; especially Indigenous people, and Black and racialized Canadians &#8211; have raised their voices and stood up to demand change.
They are telling us we must do more. The Government agrees.
The Government pledged to address systemic racism, and committed to do so in a way informed by the lived experiences of racialized communities and Indigenous Peoples.
The Government has invested in economic empowerment through the Black Entrepreneurship Program, while working to close the gaps in services for Indigenous communities. Important steps were taken with the release of Canada&#8217;s Anti-Racism Strategy for 2019-2022, the creation of an anti-racism secretariat, and the appointment of the first-ever Minister focused specifically on diversity and inclusion. This is all good, but much more needs to be done for permanent, transformative change to take shape.
The Government will redouble its efforts by:
&#8226; Taking action on online hate;
&#8226; Going further on economic empowerment for specific communities, and increasing diversity on procurement;
&#8226; Building a whole-of-federal-government approach around better collection of disaggregated data;
&#8226; Implementing an action plan to increase representation in hiring and appointments, and leadership development within the Public Service;
&#8226; And taking new steps to support the artistic and economic contributions of Black Canadian culture and heritage.
Progress must also be made throughout the policing and justice systems. All Canadians must have the confidence that the justice system is there to protect them, not to harm them. Black Canadians and Indigenous Peoples are
overrepresented in the criminal justice system. That has to change.
The Government will take steps to ensure that the strong hand of criminal justice is used where it is needed to keep people safe, but not where it would be discriminatory or counterproductive.
The Government will:
&#8226; Introduce legislation and make investments that take action to address the systemic inequities in all phases of the criminal justice system, from diversion to sentencing, from rehabilitation to records;
&#8226; Move forward on enhanced civilian oversight of our law enforcement agencies, including the RCMP;
&#8226; Modernize training for police and law enforcement, including addressing standards around the use of force;
&#8226; Move forward on RCMP reforms, with a shift toward community-led policing;
&#8226; And accelerate work to co-develop a legislative framework for First Nations policing as an essential service.

PROTECTING TWO OFFICIAL LANGUAGES
Our two official languages are woven into the fabric of our country.
The defence of the rights of Francophones outside Quebec, and the defence of the rights of the Anglophone minority within Quebec, is a priority for the Government.
The Government of Canada must also recognize that the situation of French is unique. There are almost 8 million Francophones in Canada within a region of over 360 million inhabitants who are almost exclusively Anglophone. The Government therefore has the responsibility to protect and promote French not only outside of Quebec, but also within Quebec.
In this vein, 51 years after the passage of the Official Languages Act, the Government is committed to strengthening this legislation among other things, taking into consideration the unique reality of French.

A WELCOMING CANADA
Immigration remains a driver of Canada&#8217;s economic growth.
With other countries rejecting global talent that could help their economy, Canada has an opportunity as we recover to become the world&#8217;s top destination for talent, capital, and jobs. When people choose Canada, help build Canada, and make sacrifices in support of Canada, we should make it easier for them to formally become Canadian.
Earlier this year, the Government announced measures to grant permanent residency to people who, although not Canadian citizens, had cared for the most vulnerable in long-term care homes and other medical facilities.
The Government will continue to bring in newcomers and support family reunification. We know that there is an economic and human advantage to having families together.
As part of both the short-term economic recovery and a long-term plan for growth, the Government will leverage the advantage we have on immigration to keep Canada competitive on the world stage.

CANADA IN THE WORLD
We must take action on all of these priorities at home. But we must also address the world in which we live. COVID-19 has accelerated the existing trends toward a more fragmented global order. It remains in Canada&#8217;s interest to create and maintain bilateral and multilateral relationships to advance peace and economic prosperity.
The Government will invest more in international development while supporting developing countries on their economic recoveries and resilience. Canada will also support work to ensure that people around the world have access to a vaccine. We cannot eliminate this pandemic in Canada unless we end it everywhere.
The Government will also continue to stand up for human rights and the rule of law. It is unacceptable that any citizen be arbitrarily detained. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor must be brought home. This is something for which all Canadians stand united.
The Government will continue to fight for free trade, including by leading the Ottawa Group to reform the World Trade Organization.
Our likeminded allies and partners are investing to make sure their societies emerge stronger. This Government&#8217;s plan does that as well.</div>
