Building a resilient economy means investing in people. But the work does not stop there.

After all, growing the economy and protecting the environment go hand in hand.

By focusing on innovation and good, green jobs, and by working with like-minded countries &#8211; we will build a more resilient, sustainable, and competitive economy.

As a country, we want to be leaders in producing the world&#8217;s cleanest steel, aluminum, building products, cars, and planes. Not only do we have the raw materials and energy to do that, most importantly, we have skilled, hard-working Canadians to power these industries.

As we move forward on the economy of the future, no worker or region will be left behind. The Government will bring together provinces, territories, municipalities, and Indigenous communities, as well as labour and the private sector, to tap into global capital and attract investors.

Canada will emerge from this generational challenge stronger and more prosperous.

The Government is taking real action to fight climate change. Now, we must go further, faster.

That means moving to cap and cut oil and gas sector emissions, while accelerating our path to a 100 percent net-zero electricity future.

Investing in public transit and mandating the sale of zero emissions vehicles will help us breathe cleaner air.

Increasing the price on pollution while putting more money back in Canadians&#8217; pockets will deliver a cleaner environment and a stronger economy.

Protecting our land and oceans will address biodiversity loss. In this work, the Government will continue to strengthen its partnership with First Nations, Inuit, and M&#233;tis, to protect nature and respect their traditional knowledge.

Creating the Canada Water Agency will safeguard that vital resource and support our farmers.

And to address the realities communities across the country already face, the Government will also strengthen action to prevent and prepare for floods, wildfires, droughts, coastline erosion, and other extreme weather worsened by climate change. The Government will be there to build back in communities devastated by these events. This will include the development of Canada&#8217;s first-ever National Adaptation Strategy.</div>
