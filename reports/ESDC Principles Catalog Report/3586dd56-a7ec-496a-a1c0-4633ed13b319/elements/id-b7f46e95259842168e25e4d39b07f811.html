The GC Enterprise Security Architecture program is a government&#8209;wide initiative to provide a standardized approach to developing IT security architecture, ensuring that basic security blocks are implemented across the enterprise as the infrastructure is being renewed.

Build security into the system life cycle across all architectural layers
identify and categorize information based on the degree of injury that could be expected to result from a compromise of its confidentiality, integrity and availability
How to achieve:
Summarize how the architecture ensures the confidentiality of the information based on its categorization and degree of injury
Summarize how the architecture ensures the integrity of the information based on its categorization and degree of injury
Summarize how the architecture ensures the availability of the information based on its categorization and degree of injury

implement a continuous security approach, in alignment with Centre for Cyber Security&#8217;s IT Security Risk Management Framework; perform threat modelling to minimize the attack surface by limiting services exposed and information exchanged to the minimum necessary
How to achieve:
Summarize how the architecture aligns with the Centre of Cyber Security&#8217;s IT Security Risk Management Framework

apply proportionate security measures that address business and user needs while adequately protecting data at rest and data in transit
How to achieve:
Describe the security measures that protect the data at rest while meeting business and users needs
Describe the security measures that protect the data in transit while meeting business and users needs
design systems to be resilient and available in order to support service continuity
How to achieve:
Outline the architecture&#8217;s resilient characteristics support service continuity objectives
Outline the architecture&#8217;s availability characteristics support service continuity objectives
Tools:
Non-functional Requirements
Ensure secure access to systems and services
identify and authenticate individuals, processes or devices to an appropriate level of assurance, based on clearly defined roles, before granting access to information and services; leverage enterprise services such as Government of Canada trusted digital identity solutions that are supported by the Pan&#8209;Canadian Trust Framework 
How to achieve:
Summarize how the architectures identifies and authenticates:
Individuals
Processes
Devices
Summarize the enterprise security services leverage by the architecture
Summarize how the architecture aligns to the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework
Tools:
Target State Architecture
Interim State Architecture
constrain service interfaces to authorized entities (users and devices), with clearly defined roles; segment and separate information based on sensitivity of information, in alignment with ITSG&#8209;22 and ITSG&#8209;38. Management interfaces may require increased levels of protection
How to achieve:
Summarize how the architecture constrains service interfaces to authorized entities in compliance to:
ITSG-22, and;
ITSG-38.
implement HTTPS for secure web connections and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) for enhanced email security
How to achieve:
Does the architecture use HTTPS for secure web connections
Does the architecture use and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) for enhanced email security

establish secure interconnections between systems through secure APIs or leveraging centrally managed hybrid IT connectivity services
How to achieve:
Outline what (APIs or centrally managed hybrid IT connectivity services )the architectures established secure interconnections between systems
Tools:
Target State Architecture
Interim State Architecture
Maintain secure operations
establish processes to maintain visibility of assets and ensure the prompt application of security&#8209;related patches and updates in order to reduce exposure to vulnerabilities, in accordance with GC Patch Management Guidance
How to achieve:
Have processes been established to ensure the prompt application of security related patches and updates?
Summarize how the architecture supports these processes

enable event logging, in accordance with GC Event Logging Guidance, and perform monitoring of systems and services in order to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks
How to achieve:
Summarize how event logging within the architecture aligns to GC Event Logging Guidance in the areas of:
Attack detection
Attack prevention
Attack respond
establish an incident management plan in alignment with the GC Cyber Security Event Management Plan (GC CSEMP) and report incidents to the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security
How to achieve:
Describe how incident management plan aligns to GC Cyber Security Event Management
Describe how incidents are reported to the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCSB)</div>
