Name:	Client-Centric
Statement:	Deliver high-quality, timely and accurate services that are responsive to current and emerging client needs and to continue to innovate and meet new standards of excellence.
Rationale:
&#8226;	Clients expect seamless access to a suite of integrated programs and services based on their individual needs and abilities.
Implications:
&#8226;	Services must be built around client needs 
&#8226;	Clients must be provided with a &#8220;one-stop service&#8221; that is simple and intuitive.
&#8226;	Client and employee feedback data must be collected and analyzed to improve services and inform implementation.
&#8226;	Clients are able to determine their  level of engagement with the government and/or department as permitted by legislation, public policy and program policy
&#8226;	Services must be delivered across multiple channels using modern architectures. 
&#8226;	Where appropriate, clients are directed into lower cost channels.
&#8226;	Service levels must be defined for client services provided. 
&#8226;	Services must be measured to improve performance.
&#8226;	A cross-government strategy must be built for common citizen and business data sets (e.g. name, address) and common client applications (e.g. authentication, payments, notifications).
&#8226;	Services should be accessible by the client at anytime, anywhere and on any device.
