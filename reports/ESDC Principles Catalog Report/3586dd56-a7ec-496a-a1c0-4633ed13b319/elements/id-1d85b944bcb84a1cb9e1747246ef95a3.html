Name:	Accessible-by-Default

Statement:	Information and data is open, accessible and easy to use by default, however protected within closed environments when it includes personally identify  and/or sensitive data 
Rationale:
&#8226;	The Government of Canada strives to provide Canadians with access to the data that is produced, collected, and used by departments and agencies across the federal government through a single and searchable window.
&#8226;	Information and Data are easily findable and consumable, in the appropriate format for a variety of users and scenarios.
&#8226;	Benefits of open data include:
    o	Support for innovation
    o	Advancing the government's accountability and democratic reform 
    o	Leveraging public sector information to develop consumer and commercial products 
    o	Better use of existing investment in broadband and community information infrastructure 
    o	Support for research 
    o	Support informed decisions for clients 
    o	Proactive Disclosure
&#8226;	Information and Data are ubiquitous, but to be of business value the constraints challenging its access and use must be mitigated as much as is appropriate to do so. 

Implications:
&#8226;	Unless sensitive or containing personally identifiable data, the data is accessible to all employees of ESDC.
&#8226;	When designing services and systems, opportunities for publishing open data must be explored. Data can be published in different formats, or made accessible through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). 
&#8226;	Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide on-demand access to large, timely or complex data.
&#8226;	Information and Data holdings must be aligned to business needs and functions.
&#8226;	Information and Data are clearly catalogued, easily discoverable and easily accessible.
&#8226;	Access must be closely tied to understanding of the data, otherwise inappropriate use may occur.
&#8226;	Information and Data consumers&#8217; awareness and education of data sources must be sustained.
&#8226;	Information and Data are in the appropriate tool and format for use and users know how to access it.
&#8226;	Efficient / timely access to information / data and its protection are not mutually exclusive concepts.
&#8226;	Information and Data repositories need to be managed to reduce redundancies and duplication.
&#8226;	Information and Data presentation must match generally accepted internal or external standards.
&#8226;	Levels of aggregation or disaggregation are appropriate for consumption purposes.
&#8226;	Timeliness of access permits the right data to be available when it is needed.
&#8226;	Mashup of Information and Data will push the boundaries of user understanding and will need training and support.
&#8226;	Knowledge repositories should capture enterprise information in ways to be useful as a basis for designing programs and services to improve future outcomes.
&#8226;	Business and Information Professionals must partner to ensure user/consumer perspective is enabled.
&#8226;	Information and data is now found in many forms and under many constraints.
&#8226;	Boundaries or constraints can include legal, geographic, ownership, sovereignty, language, format, application, technology, security, privacy, etc.; the goal is to architect by considering these boundaries, not to circumvent them.
&#8226;	Data architecture or lineage and flow must be such that we can utilize, process, and share data regardless of constraints.
&#8226;	Data if possible should reside where it is and not re-created or moved.
&#8226;	Intellectual property must be respected and maintained regardless of constraints.
&#8226;	A federated management / stewardship approach may be applied in certain circumstances.
&#8226;	Availability must not suffer due to insufficiently designed and implemented solutions.
&#8226;	Third party processing (supply chain security) policies and architectures should be designed and monitored (i.e., our data must be under our rules at all times and locations).
