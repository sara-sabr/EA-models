Data Model ABB is a Data Object aiming to be a collection of entities, their properties and the relationships among them, which focus at formally representing a domain, a concept or a real-world thing.

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:
IoP Dimension: Structural IoP, Behavioral IoP, Governance IoP
The Data Model ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it ensures compatible interpretations of data exchange as specified in the document "Methodology and tools for metadata governance and management for EU Institutions", developed under the SEMIC action of the ISA Programme: "Whilst technological developments offer various means to automate the exchange of information, technological developments alone cannot guarantee a greater interoperability between information systems. A fundamental aspect is the need for common data standards: primarily data models and reference data [...]".

EXAMPLES:
The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): 

ESPD - Exchange data model 
The ESPD exchange data model (ESPD-EDM) is used for the ESPD service provided by the European Commission.
The ESPD Exchange Data Model was designed to implement the data requirements expressed in the Annex 2 of the COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2016/7 of 5 January 2016 (from now on "the Annex to the Regulation 2016/7"), establishing the standard form for the European Single Document. Additionally to these requirements, the model took also into account the Information Requirements Model specified by the CEN/BII-Workshops.[3] (namely Workshop 3), and the latest developments relating to the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD) in e-Sens.[4].
One premise that has ruled the design and implementation life-cycle of the ESPD-EDM has been ''not to reinvent the wheel''. Thus some very early key decisions were: 

(i)	select a mature business language for the naming, design and implementation of the ESPD-EDM; 
(ii)	reuse as much as possible existing information components and libraries ''as-they-are''; 
(iii)	for those entities that are not defined in any standard specification, design new components in such a way that they can be reused in other situations and domains, both in e-Procurement and beyond e-Procurement.

OASIS UBL-2.1 standard was chosen as the best candidate to base the ESPD-EDM upon. The main reasons for this decisions were: 
i.	The European Commission is already using (and recommending) UBL-2.1 for e-Documents.[5] ; 
ii.	Most of the concepts and components necessary for the ESPD documents were already defined by UBL specifically for e-Procurement; (3) Methodology and tools are available for the development of new documents, the extension of the existing UBL libraries, the semantic validation of XML instances, etc.
