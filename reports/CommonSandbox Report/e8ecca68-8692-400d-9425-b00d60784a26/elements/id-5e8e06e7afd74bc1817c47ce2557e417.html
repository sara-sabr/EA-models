Project Number: 202100024
Project Name: Learning Management System Renewal
BizArch Lead IAG: Dan R

Alignment to Strategy
This project does support Accessibility Compliance legislation, Government of Canada Cloud first enablement approaches and guidelines and ESDC priorities of modernizing Human Resources Services and deliveries.

BizArch Recommendations:
This project presents several opportunities to implement a long term secure cloud based Learning Management Solution (LMS), meeting accessibility requirements, with potential to interoperate with other strategic HR and Business line IT/IM solutions. This will create a more enterpriseable solution to be reuse by many other solutions and supported for many years to come.

BizArch Category: Life Cycle Management
BizArch Category Reasoning: Business Architecture consider this project as a Life Cycle Management type of initiatives. It is replacing technology at end of vendor support (SABA) with newer technology supporting GC and ESDC priorities in accessibility and security to name a few.

BizArch Criticality: Medium
BizArch Criticality Reasoning: Business Architecture consider Criticality to Medium in view of the current solution that support most of the requirements and will still do so while this organization are addressing new concerns and priorities to be supported and implemented in the new solution.

BizArch Alignment: Medium
BizArch Alignment Reasoning: Accessible, Cloud based and Secure solution are priorities of both GC and ESDC. Please keep in mind that opportunities to interoperate with other HR related solutions should be considered as much as possible to be relevant in the future of this organization.

BizArch Urgency: Medium
BizArch Urgency Reasoning: August 2023 is the end of support of SABA. At this time, with a 24 months time frame to accomplish the transition to another solution is acceptable and doable.
