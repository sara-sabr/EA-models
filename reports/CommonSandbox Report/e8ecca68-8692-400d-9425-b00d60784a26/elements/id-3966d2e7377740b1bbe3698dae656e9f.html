Create multidisciplinary teams with the range of skills needed to deliver a common goal. Share and collaborate in the open. Identify and create partnerships which help deliver value to users.

Guidance: Collaborate widely
Collaborating widely allows us to learn from others to minimize mistakes already experienced and reduces work through identifying and sharing existing solutions. The problems that government solves are often unique, though they are not unique amongst governments.

Many of the same solutions by the same, or similar vendors, are used throughout the world, or at varying levels of government within different jurisdictions. When designing a service, or implementing a service using tools or systems, identify which other departments, jurisdictions, or organizations, have leveraged similar technologies to solve similar use cases in order to collaborate widely, reduce work, share solutions, and benefit from lessons already learned by others. Furthermore, using multidisciplinary teams, especially when coupled with the empowerment of staff, the government improves its posture to deliver modern and innovative services. Through wide collaboration, organizations begin to break down the silos developed over time through the overreliance on functionally based teams. Going forward, working across skill sets, and leveraging work from others, while learning from their lessons, promotes the development of modern services better able to meet the changing needs of citizens in the digital age.

Aligned Behaviours
1. Our team is multidisciplinary, having all the skills and capabilities required to fully deliver our service to users.
2. Our team is active in communities of practice, events, or groups that pertain to the areas of expertise of team members.
3. Our team has identified, and collaborates with, other teams, in or outside of our organisation, including other levels of government, other governments, the public, or private sector organizations, who have done, or are doing, similar work.
4. Our team documents any APIs for our service using modern and common protocols and standards and provides examples to others regarding their use.
5. Our team uses data from performance monitoring tools to inform business decisions.

Misaligned Behaviours
1. Our team develops most of the service on our own, without leveraging existing solutions and services to reduce duplication of effort.
2. Our team overwhelmingly relies on tickets to manage collaboration between internal stakeholders or teams.
3. The team does not consider the impacts on teams working across the value stream, or on the outcome of the service.</div>
