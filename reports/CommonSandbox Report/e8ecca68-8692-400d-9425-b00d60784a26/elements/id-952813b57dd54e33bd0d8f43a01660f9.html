Share evidence, research and decision making openly. Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence.

Guidance: Work in the open by default
Working in the open increases the transparency of services, increases trust in government, creates an ecosystem that promotes innovation, prevents needing to reinvent the wheel by increasing collaboration within, and external to, government. Working in the open promotes understanding of government processes and services and creates an environment whereby innovation can take place throughout the Government of Canada and through non-governmental organizations leveraging the government data and information to improve service delivery for Canadians.

This way of working aligns Canada with the Digital Nations Charter, of which it is a signatory and promotes &#8220;transparency and citizen participation and uses open licences to produce and consume open data&#8221;, and the Open Data Charter. Further, by working in the open the Government of Canada can increase its reuse of existing public solutions and allow others to reuse work conducted by the Government of Canada. 

Aligned Behaviours
1. Teams continually makes all non-sensitive and non-personal data, information, and new code publicly available, or at a minimum accessible across the GC, for sharing and reuse.
2. Our team contributes back to the public projects from which they borrow content.
3. Our team tracks and makes public the metrics upon which our team measures its success.
4. Our team tracks, and makes publicly available, or at a minimum accessible across the GC, information regarding how often a change to our services fails (e.g., the deployment or rollout of a service or feature experiences issues or complications).
5. Our team makes visual displays which show what they&#8217;re working on and the status of their work available publicly, or at least throughout the Government of Canada.
6. Our team publicly documents, including examples of reuse, how others can use their service&#8217;s APIs, open data, or information.

Misaligned Behaviours
1. All of the team's work is done on systems behind the corporate firewall.
2. The work of our team has permissions set so that only members of our team can access the team's work.
3. Our team does not contribute to, or collaborate on, work being done by our colleagues.
4. Team applies blanket security classification for the digital system to all data stored by the application.
5. Our team has no process by which to declassify and release records when they are no longer protected or classified.
6. The documentation for our APIs is only available to internal approved consumers.</div>
