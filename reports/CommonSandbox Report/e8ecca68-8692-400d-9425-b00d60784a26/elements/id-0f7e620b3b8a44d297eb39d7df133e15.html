Name:	Common Understanding and Trusted
Statement:	Business and program terminology and data are defined consistently throughout the Department, and the definitions and values are understandable, trusted and available to all users.
Rationale:
&#8226;	A common vocabulary facilitates communications and enables effective dialogue.
&#8226;	The data that will be used in the development of services must have a common definition throughout the Department to enable sharing of data. 
&#8226;	Information and Data are meaningfully defined from an enterprise perspective by the appropriate authorities, and are obtained from reliable, authoritative and understood data flows and sources. 

Implications:
&#8226;	The Department must establish the initial common vocabulary for the business based on open standards where available. The definitions will be used uniformly throughout the Department.
&#8226;	Multiple concurrent definitions must be replaced by a definition that is accepted and understood by the entire Department.
&#8226;	Whenever a new definition is required, the definition effort will be co-coordinated and reconciled with the corporate "glossary". 
&#8226;	Clarity and integrity of information / data is crucial to supporting business processes
&#8226;	Building trust in data requires a multi-faceted approach.
&#8226;	Metadata capture and utilisation must be mandatory in all processes and systems
&#8226;	Data and its associated metadata must be an integral part of any business process design
&#8226;	Information and data lineage (flow) and applied business rules must be documented and available
&#8226;	Stewards must clearly define business terms and data elements, aligned to business programs to provide a common enterprise vocabulary, thus allowing for enterprise-wide use and interoperability
&#8226;	Stewards need a simple and repeatable process to define, have approved and publish definitions and other metadata for information and data elements
&#8226;	Stewards and all consumers need a repository, tied to important systems to capture / consume metadata 
&#8226;	Stewards will direct custodians in their activities as relates data aspects
&#8226;	Properly identified data custodians are solely responsible for data capture to ensure integrity and quality and reduce redundant efforts and storage/processing
&#8226;	Data governance and stewardship provide the means to ensure that enterprise data can be trusted 
&#8226;	Enterprise Information and Data should be located in authoritative sources 
&#8226;	Without trust in data consumers may develop their own siloed and redundant solutions/repositories.
