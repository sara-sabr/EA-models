Develop services using agile, iterative and user-centred methods. Continuously improve in response to user needs. Try new things, start small and scale up.

Guidance: Iterate and improve frequently
In contrast to high risk and long lead time &#8216;big bang&#8217; deployments, working services must be put in the hands of users as early as possible to get rapid feedback. Said feedback is then used to iterate upon to improve the service.

One sets a north star to define a clear direction, then begins iterating towards this north star, keeping in mind that the path is not clear, and unexpected circumstances will require adjustments to be made along the way. By leveraging modern technologies and modern approaches to working, risk can be reduced by limiting the size of changes and increasing their frequency. Processes should empower teams to deliver value to services as often as possible, rather than increase risk by creating prolonged processes that use documentation in place of demonstrably functioning software. Focus on working software over comprehensive documentation and remember that perfect is the enemy of good.

Aligned Behaviours
1. There are processes in place to prioritize and implement feedback from peers, stakeholders and end-users.
2. When a new or updated service or feature is being created our team understands the minimum requirements for the system to be of value to users.
3. Our team experiments with new approaches based on team reflections, lessons learned, and user feedback.
4. Our team collects metrics to improve upon which are used throughout the development and lifecycle of the service.
5. When resolving problems our team dedicates time to identify the root cause of the issue and address it.
6. Our team is relentlessly inspecting, adapting, and automating their processes to increase the speed at which our team can deliver value to users.
7. Our team has access to environments and resources to allow for rapid prototyping while initial requirements are being sought.
8. Our team embraces learning about and using new digital skills, approaches, and tools to incorporate into our daily work.

Misaligned Behaviours
1. Our team only shares their work once it has been finalized and approved.
2. Decisions regarding the direction of our team are made without reference to any collected performance metrics.
3. Our team identifies solutions before it is clear what outcomes our team is working towards and how to measure them.
4. Processes are rarely, if ever, reviewed to find and implement efficiencies.
5. Our team must wait for the project to be approved and funded prior to environments being made available to teams to begin experimenting with solutions.
6. Our team fully architects the end to the service delivery solution prior to starting to build.</div>
