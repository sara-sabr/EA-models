Option Description:  
This option consists of configuring the required changes to support the commitment of implementing a robust enforcement system for the EI program and the Pensions program (CPP and OAS). This option consists of starting with an instance of the existing ICMS Microsoft (MS) Dynamics system and configuring workflows for each specific program and function. There would need to be a secure wall between enforcement and the TFW/IMP/Compliance work and ISB would need to assign special roles and access to Enforcement data has to be guaranteed to be locked down. This will allow ISB to have a common case management system across its functional delivery network and leverage existing knowledge, expertise, processes, and tools to create a synergy across programs. This option builds on the success of developing a robust case management system for the TFWP and the IMP. Quality monitoring and control will be incorporated within the solution.

This option will allow ISB to leverage the enterprise system and acquired knowledge obtained during the first phase of the project. Undertaking the configuration in-house, therefore reduces the dependency on external suppliers, and continues to build the confidence and expertise achieved during the first phase of the Modernization of Integrity Case Management (MICM). This option will also allow building additional knowledge about case management within ESDC to ensure sustainability of the developed product, and therefore reduce maintenance cost in the long term. 

In addition, onboarding all ISB&#8217;s programs to the same system ensures a common transition plan for the long-term transformation objectives of ESDC. As ESDC moves forward with innovative service delivery methods, ISB would realize economies of scale by having a common system for the delivery of all its services. 

Finally, senior developers that configured the ICMS are the same that currently maintain NIIS. This in-house expertise has gained business knowledge and deep understanding in development of investigative-oriented tools and this expertise can be leveraged. 

Option Dependencies: 
&#8226;	IITB areas continue to have IT capacity to develop automated data and information transfers to ISB.

Option Assumptions:  
&#8226;	Government supports the established direction and visions on technology transformations; and 
&#8226;	Government supports moving forward with enterprise solutions and standard applications.

Option Constraints:  
&#8226;	A shortage of key subject experts (program or technical) dedicated to the project could impact the project schedule and timelines;
&#8226;	The ICMS solution will be reviewed to understand if the application may/may not be able to support the required documentation and processing standards required by the Enforcement team;
&#8226;	The ICMS solution will be reviewed to understand if the application may/may not be able to attach images, video files, audio files, scanned documents, photos, etc. with the required security and tracking. We need to keep in mind the full suite of requirements for prosecution which also includes change tracking, security of data and evidence recording and tracking;

 
Feasibility: Feasible but not recommended
Reasoning:  
Option 3 rating against the following evaluation criteria:
1.	Delivery of an Enforcement solution by March 31, 2022 &#8211; the project would be unable to deliver the basic Enforcement capabilities by the due date; Enhanced capabilities could be delivered in future releases;
2.	Cost to implement, operate and retire solution &#8211; MICM2 cost is defined below; the cost to develop a solution could be higher than purchasing software;
3.	Degree and timeliness of benefits realization &#8211; the implementation of a basic enforcement solution by the TBS due date will support some, but, not all, of the outlined benefits within the required timeframe;
4.	Risk associated with solution implementation and benefits realization &#8211; developing a solution on a COTS product will have additional risks than purchasing a purpose-built solution due to the development of new code;
5.	Implementation considerations &#8211; a similar application was successfully implemented for TFWP and IMP from the MICM project. ISB is using the lessons learned from that project to improve our delivery capabilities with this new project;
6.	Organizational readiness to adopt and take full advantage of solution &#8211; the Enforcement functionality within ISB is being revised, based on recommendations and the introduction of a new software solution will be closely tied to the revision timeframes;
7.	Ability to deliver on the following requirements: audit trail, data security, compatibility with external agencies &#8211; the solution will be developed to deliver full audit trails, enhance data security and improve the data provided to external agencies, but, the project will require additional releases in addition to the original release; and
8.	Scalability of the solution and the adaptability to add new features in the future &#8211; the ICMS system would use the newest technologies that have scalability and adaptability built in.

&#8195;
Option Cost Identification

The following table defines the estimated costs to proceed with this option.
Major Cost Item	Lifecycle	Type &#8211; Goods, services or salary	Estimated Value	Assumptions
Project Costs for ISB staff and consulting to support business initiatives	Planning, Implementation, Testing, Training, and Closure
	Salary &amp; Services	TBD	
Project Costs for IITB staff and consulting for system configuration	Planning, Development, Testing, Implementation	Salary and Services	TBD	
Training of user community	Implementation	Services	TBD	
Total Costs			TBD	

Option Cost Summary
The Option Cost Summary takes the implementation and annual operating costs and divides them by the number of years that the solution will be in use to get an Average Annual Lifecycle costs.
Cost Category	Cost ($)	Cost Assumptions
Implementation Cost (IC)	TBD	Assumptions for Implementation, based on information in previous table
Annual Operating Cost (AOC)	TBD	From IITB Cost Work Book
Decommissioning Cost (DC)	N/A	Assumptions for Decommissioning Cost 
Total Lifecycle Cost (TLC)	TBD	Assumptions for Total Lifecycle Cost based on Implementation cost + yearly operating costs over the 10-year life span &#8211; will be adjusted once FMA approved costing received
Average Annual Lifecycle Costs (AALC)	TBD
	Assumption for Average Life Cycle Cost, based on a 10-year life span of the new solution &#8211; will be adjusted once FMA approved costing is received.

&#8195;
Benefits Analysis
This area will be completed once the FMA provides us the cost workbook for both ISB and IITB.

Preliminary Risk Identification
The following preliminary risks have been identified for this option: 
Source of Risk 	Risk Definition / Context 
Internal &#8211; Business Requirements	Validating existing requirements in the system to identify whether they apply to the new system may be more complex than anticipated.
Internal &#8211; Data migration	For transition, migration of existing legacy data including case status may be more complex than anticipated.
Internal &#8211; Impact on Business (change management)	Implementing a new system will change existing operational processes and embedded culture and may disrupt established networks for staff.
External &#8211; Interconnectivity	Program management between the TMB, BISB and the project-sponsoring branch must align to ensure interconnectivity between ongoing projects is in place.
External &#8211; Interoperability	The capabilities to link to other datasets, systems and their existing state may cause some dis-benefits or require major workarounds for business operations.
External &#8211; Stakeholder Engagement	Adopting an agile approach to support optimal documentation requires continued stakeholder involvement and is depending on evolving priorities.

Implementation and Capacity Considerations
Stakeholder Impacts:
1.	ESDC and ISB will receive a positive impact from the costs savings for implementation of new systems and increased efficiency in the handling of compliance and enforcement cases within the affected programs;
2.	Canadian Citizens will experience increased fairness due to the added investigational coverage and consistent delivery processes;
3.	IITB Development staff will be positively impacted by the new skills they will learn and the ability to support current equipment and software solutions;
4.	ESDC Personnel &#8211; ISB-NHQ and regional staff will have an application that will enable case management with supported automation, such as auto-distribution, reporting, and business rules;
5.	ESDC personnel &#8211; Regional Integrity Operations will have a consistency in the delivery of modern services and processes;
6.	ESDC Personnel will be using an application that provides the following software product qualities &#8211; Functional Suitability, Reliability, Performance efficiency, Operability, Security, Compatibility, Maintainability and Portability;
7.	IITB Development staff will be impacted by the retention of programmer and systems analyst talent as a by-product of using modern systems and development languages;
8.	Benefit Delivery Service Branch will be impacted by the reliability of data provided by the case management Application and the improved service access; and
9.	External LE Agencies will be impacted by the consistent service and cases provided by ESDC.

Project Management Capacity:
Over the last fiscal year, ISB has created a PDO to centralize the function and to help increase its overall maturity level in PM. Specifically, for this project, ISB has assigned a Project Manager, two Deputy Project Managers, change management and business analysis staff to this effort. Between them, the project will have thirty years of project experience and more than ten years of ISB experience. 
The project will be tracked using the ESDC PM framework, with the associated support from ESDC&#8217;s EPMO. ESDC executives will be kept informed of the project progress by monthly dashboard reporting and the necessary project-gating process.
The solution implementation will be monitored by IITB, who will be assigning a technical manager to coordinate the efforts. A project governance approach between IITB, ISB and regional executives will be implemented with a focus on team integration, transparency between enablers, and decisive issue resolution approach between responsible executives.
Lessons learned from the development and deployment of the TFWP/IMP ICMS system has, and will continue to be leveraged. One of the key project success points was the high integration between program, project and technical resources.
Based on the implementation and capacity listed above, the ability to implement the option is rated as High.

Organizational Readiness Analysis
The following concerns have been identified regarding readiness of ISB to adopt and take full advantage of this solution option:
Organizational Readiness Considerations
1.	ISB is currently executing an initiative to define the business model to process Enforcement cases;
2.	Involvement from the ISB regional community, with the ongoing enforcement project, has been at the levels and effort that ISB requires to complete the work. Regional and NHQ staff have bought into the proposed changes to support the new Enforcement model and ISB expects this level of commitment to continue;
3.	Within the ISB department, this project and associated Enforcement Maturity Model work, has a high priority and staff are available as required and sufficient funding is in place to support both efforts; and
4.	The ISB team has a dedicated Change Management group who will ensure that the end-user community will be informed of the proposed changes and will have the necessary training to support the system moving forward.
Based on the organizational readiness considerations above, the organizational readiness to adopt this option is rated as High.</div>
