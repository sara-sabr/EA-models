						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">TB&#8217;s Policy on Service and Digital is estimated to have 247 requirements applying to the departmental Chief Information Officer (CIO) function. Along with this are key changes, which produce new expectations for Deputy Heads in the areas of service, information and data, technology, cyber security, as well as workforce capacity and capability. To comply with the Policy, a methodological gap analysis was performed by IITB teams to determine the policy-driven requirements based on five themes: 
&#61656; Governance, planning and reporting (as it relates to IT governance and planning within ESDC);
&#61656; Service Design and Delivery;
&#61656; Information and Data;
&#61656; Technology (including automated decision making); and,
&#61656; Cyber Security and Identity.
The gap analysis looked at IITB&#8217;s existing investments and priorities and made 12 recommendations for IITB to either create new initiatives or reprioritize its portfolio of activities. Most of these recommendations are already in progress as part of the IITB Way Forward. The top five prioritized recommendations are:
&#61656; Clarify the role and responsibilities between the CDO and the CIO;
&#61656; Establish the role of a designated official for Cyber Security (DOCS);
&#61656; Review IM/IT and Identity Policies to address redundancy, conflicts, user-centered policy writing, and training;
&#61656; Harmonize the different service inventories for a single source of truth; and,
&#61656; Formalize automated decision-making governance at ESDC.
These recommendations reflect the integrated management of functions as expected by the Policy, the increased responsibilities of the CIO, and the unique governance entities within ESDC (e.g. use of a CDO, a Chief Security Officer outside the branch of the CIO, and a tier 2 level committee focused on purely on service). 
In addition, the Branches within the Department have been collaborating internally to improve service delivery and digital transformation:
&#61656; Business Architecture and Alignment Office participates regularly at EA activities as one of the EA domains in developing project architectures; 
&#61656; User Experience Team provides UX research and design services to IT project teams regularly; and,
&#61656; Business Process Management Team provides guidance and services on business process mapping to IT project teams regularly.</div>
