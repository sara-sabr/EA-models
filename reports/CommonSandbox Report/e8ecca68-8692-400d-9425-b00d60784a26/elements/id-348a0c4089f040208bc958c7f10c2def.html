						<textarea id="docsrc" style="display:none">6.2.5	Option 5 &#8211; Wait for the implementation of the Benefits Delivery Modernization Program. 
Option Description:  
This option consists of putting this project on hold while ESDC completes the BDM. ESDC is working on the BDM program and this program will support the EI, CPP, and OAS programs in the future. ISB could decide to wait for the implementation of BDM and then migrate the existing (legacy) systems to the new solution at that time. Based on information received at the time of this writing, although this approach is feasible, it would not meet the TBS requirement to have an Enforcement solution in place by March 31, 2022. 

Thus, waiting for the completion of the BDM program is not recommended due to timing constraints.

Option Dependencies: 
&#8226;	Due to the limited knowledge of the BDM solution, we cannot add any dependencies.

Option Assumptions:  
&#8226;	Due to the limited knowledge of the BDM solution, we cannot add an assumption.

Option Constraints:  
&#8226;	Due to the limited knowledge of the BDM solution, we cannot add any constraints.

Feasibility: Feasible but not recommended
Reasoning:  
Option 5 rating against the following evaluation criteria:
1.	Delivery of an Enforcement solution by March 31, 2022 &#8211; this approach cannot deliver by the due date;
2.	Cost to implement, operate and retire solution &#8211; the cost to develop the solution is unknown at this time as no service provider has been contracted;
3.	Degree and timeliness of benefits realization &#8211; it is unknown at this time if BDM solution would realize the defined benefits;
4.	Risk associated with solution implementation and benefits realization &#8211; waiting for the completion of BDM will add additional risks to the daily operations of the department and could result in the loss of data due to the age of the equipment and case processing delays;
5.	Implementation considerations &#8211; it is unknown at this time what the implementation considerations are for the BDM solution;
6.	Organizational readiness to adopt and take full advantage of solution &#8211; it is unknown at this time what the nature of the BDM solution and therefore we cannot comment on the organizational readiness;
7.	Ability to deliver on the following requirements&#8212; audit trail, data security, compatibility with external agencies &#8212; due to our limited knowledge on the BDM solution we are unable to state if all key requirements will be delivered; and
8.	Scalability of the solution and the adaptability to add new features in the future &#8211; due to our limited knowledge on the BDM solution we are unable to comment on the scalability of the solution.



&#8195;
Option Cost Identification &#8211; Estimates cannot be provided as the project would be unable to meet the TBS commitment date and we are uncertain of the BDM product capabilities.

The following table defines the estimates costs to proceed with this option.
Major Cost Item	Lifecycle	Type &#8211; Goods, services or salary	Estimated Value	Assumptions
Third-party costs	Third-party software and services	Services	TBD	New product procurement.
Project costs for ISB staff and consulting to support business initiatives	Planning, implementation, testing, training and closure	Salary and Services	TBD	Timing is unknown.
Project costs for IITB staff and consulting for system configuration	Planning, development, testing, implementation	Salary and Services	TBD	
Training of user community	Implementation	Services	TBD	
Total Cost			TBD	

Option Cost Summary
The option cost summary takes the implementation and annual operating costs and divides them by the number of years that the solution will be in use to get an Average Annual Lifecycle costs.
Cost Category	Cost ($)	Cost Assumptions
Implementation Cost (IC)	TBD	
Annual Operating Cost (AOC)	TBD 	
Decommissioning Cost (DC)	TBD	
Total Lifecycle Cost (TLC)	TBD	
Average Annual Lifecycle Costs (AALC)	TBD 	

&#8195;
Preliminary Risk Identification
The following preliminary risks have been identified for this option: 
Source of Risk 	Risk Definition / Context 
Internal &#8211; Business Requirements	Validating existing requirements in the system to identify whether they apply to the BDM application may be more complex than anticipated.
Internal &#8211; Data migration	For transition, migration of existing legacy data including case status may be more complex than anticipated, or not possible. 
Internal &#8211; Impact on Business (change management)	Implementing a new system will change existing operational processes and embedded culture and may disrupt established networks for staff.
Internal &#8211; Loss of data	As the deliverable timelines are unknown at this time, there is a risk that we could have problems with the existing systems and the possibility of data loss increases as equipment ages.
External &#8211; Interconnectivity	Program management between the TMB, BISB and the project-sponsoring branch must align to ensure interconnectivity between ongoing projects is in place.
External &#8211; Interoperability	The capabilities to link to other datasets, systems and their existing state may cause some dis-benefits or require major workarounds for business operations.
External &#8211; Non-Compliance	While waiting on the BDM solution to be implemented, there is a risk that our Enforcement may be in non-compliance with legal requirements affecting our ability to properly process cases. 
External &#8211; Stakeholder Engagement	Adopting an agile approach to support optimal documentation requires continued stakeholder involvement and is dependent on evolving priorities. There will be certain legal standards and requirements as well regarding how the application is used and data is captured and shared.

Implementation and Capacity Considerations
Stakeholder Impacts:
1.	ESDC and ISB will receive a positive impact from the costs savings for implementation of new systems and increased efficiency in the handling of enforcement cases within the affected programs;
2.	Canadian citizens will experience increased fairness due to the added investigational coverage and consistent delivery processes;
3.	ESDC personnel &#8211; Regional Integrity Operations will have a consistency in the delivery of modern services and processes; and
4.	External LE Agencies will be impacted by the consistent service and cases provided by ESDC.


Project Management Capacity:
Over the last fiscal year, ISB has created a PDO to centralize the function and to help increase its overall maturity level in PM. Specifically, for this project, ISB has assigned a Project Manager, two Deputy Project Managers, change management and business analysis staff to this effort. Between them, the project will have over thirty years of project experience and more than ten years of ISB experience. 
The project will be tracked using the ESDC PM framework, with the associated support from ESDC&#8217;s EPMO. ESDC executives will be kept informed of the project progress by monthly dashboard reporting and the necessary project-gating process.
The BDM vendor will provide his or her own internal PM staff to ensure that the implementation is delivered when required by ESDC. ESDC PM will establish ongoing project update meetings with the third-party vendor that will allow for the sharing of status information and ongoing project discussions.
Based on the implementation and capacity listed above, the ability to implement the option is rated as high.

Organizational Readiness Analysis
The following concerns have been identified regarding ISB&#8217;s readiness to adopt and take full advantage of this solution option:
Organizational Readiness Considerations
1.	ISB is currently executing an initiative to define the business model to process Enforcement cases;
2.	Involvement from the ISB regional community, with the ongoing enforcement project, has been at the levels and effort that ISB requires to complete the work. Regional and NHQ staff have bought into the proposed changes to support the new Enforcement model and ISB expects this level of commitment to continue;
3.	Within the ISB department, this project and associated Enforcement Maturity Model work, has a high priority and staff are available as required and sufficient funding is in place to support both efforts; and
4.	The ISB team has a dedicated Change Management group who will ensure that the end-user community will be informed of the proposed changes and will have the necessary training to support the system moving forward.
Based on the organizational readiness considerations above, the organizational readiness to adopt this option is rated as High.</textarea>
