						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">ESDC has a mandate to help build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, help Canadians live productive and rewarding lives, and improve Canadians' quality of life. At the heart of this mandate are the policies, programs, services and benefits that support our most vulnerable -- the unemployed, people with disabilities, the homeless and the elderly. Last year alone, Service Canada provided $122 billion in direct benefits to 9.5 million Canadians.

To ensure that ESDC can continue to deliver on this important mandate in the future, we have embarked on a department-wide transformation to improve the client experience during their journey with Employment Insurance (EI), Old Age Security (OAS) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) programs.

The Benefits Delivery Modernization (BDM) Programme is leading this transformation.

BDM Programme signifies a long-term commitment to modernization. Over the next 10 years, many projects will focus on improving our statutory programs in three key areas.  They are:

Service Excellence: we want to deliver an outstanding experience for clients, delivering benefits and services when they need them. We also want an organization that embeds quality and integrity in service design.  
Policy Agility: we want to be able to adapt policy rapidly to changing needs and priorities of Canadians and their government.
Transformed Organization: we want our workforce to have the authority, skills, tools, and training to make it all happen. 

The four phases, called tranches, are moving at this deliberate pace to ensure changes are done properly and in an integrated way. It also means we can adjust the plan as we go and keep employees informed and prepared.</div>
