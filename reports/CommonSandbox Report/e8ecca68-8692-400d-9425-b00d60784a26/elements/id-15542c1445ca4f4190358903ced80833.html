Option Description
This option requires assigning resources to work on the NIIS system, contrary to current departmental priorities. Development would be performed in house using existing IT resources. Changes would include:
&#8226;	Making changes to the automated workload distribution module to address EI, CPP and OAS enforcement work distribution requirements;
&#8226;	Database changes to handle the new data imported into the system;
&#8226;	Developing a screen that would display the EI, CPP/OAS and SIN data that would be imported to the system;
&#8226;	Develop mechanisms for automated loading of data/cases being referred to ISB from Information Collection and Synthesis Team (ICST);
&#8226;	Development of actions/forms/correspondence to address work related to Enforcement;
&#8226;	Creating a fraud module to handle criminal investigations and enforcement; and
&#8226;	Integration with the Information Technology Renewal Delivery System (ITRDS) &#8211; the CPP system of record.

Option Dependencies:  
&#8226;	Current business needs are treated on a case-by-case fashion and limited to a defined scope of schedule, assigned resource level (less than $500K) and limited complexity. This is to limit the disruptive impact on the legacy system and IITB resources.

Option Assumptions:  
&#8226;	There are sufficient IITB staff available to perform the work efforts required to maintain the systems;
&#8226;	The department is committed to supporting these older applications for 10+ years;
&#8226;	Individuals with the obsolete skill sets can be retained; and
&#8226;	The mainframe will be decommissioned when BDM is available.

Option Constraints:  
&#8226;	There may not be sufficient IITB staff available to perform the work effort;
&#8226;	Knowledgeable and trained individuals to perform this work are not readily available and the cost to hire and train individuals is too high;
&#8226;	The equipment used to execute the applications is near end-of-life and may not be operational in 10+ years; difficulty in sourcing replacement parts;
&#8226;	Individuals with the obsolete skill sets may not be available; and
&#8226;	The Department&#8217;s plan may not allow modifications to these older applications.

Feasibility: Not Feasible
&#8195;
Reasoning:  
Option 2 meets the immediate need for supporting the commitment of implementing a robust enforcement system to support the EI, CPP/OAS and SIN programs Enforcement needs. Yet, this option goes against the current transformation effort and IT renewal initiatives undertaken in the last 10 years at ESDC. The cost to implement the system modification within NIIS would require an increase in IITB resources, adding systems and staff risks. The existing NIIS system may not be able to deliver on all key requirements and may not meet the enforcement deadline of March 31, 2022. The existing system is therefore only a partially viable option.
Option 2 rating against the evaluation criteria:
1.	Delivery of an Enforcement solution by March 31, 2022 &#8211; minimal capabilities would be available by the due date but the development of Enforcement capabilities would not be completed and it is uncertain that the system can be modified to support the new Enforcement requirements;
2.	Cost to implement, operate and retire solution &#8211; the cost to develop a solution may be higher than estimated as we do not know the entire timeframe for implementation;
3.	Degree and timeliness of benefits realization &#8211; the implementation of some basic enforcement capabilities by the TBS due date will support some, but, not all, of the outlined benefits within the required timeframe;
4.	Risk associated with solution implementation and benefits realization &#8211; as the development will be completed using older technology, there is a risk of delays to the timeline and capabilities provided;
5.	Implementation considerations &#8211; the IITB team will have to ensure sufficient knowledgeable resources are available to fulfill the Enforcement requirements on the existing platform;
6.	Organizational readiness to adopt and take full advantage of solution &#8211; the Enforcement functionality within ISB is being revised, based on recommendations and the introduction of a new software solution will not match the revision timeframes;
7.	Ability to deliver on the following requirements: audit trail, data security, evidence security and compatibility with external agencies &#8211; the solution would be developed to deliver full audit trails, enhance data security and improve the data provided to external agencies, but, the timeframe will be extended as the project will require additional releases in addition to the original release; and
8.	Scalability of the solution and the adaptability to add new features in the future &#8211; it is uncertain if the existing application can provide the scalability and adaptability required to support the new Enforcement capabilities.

Cost Category	Cost ($)	Cost Assumptions
Implementation Cost (IC)	TBD	Assumptions for Implementation, based on information in previous table
Annual Operating Cost (AOC)	TBD	From IITB Cost Work Book
Decommissioning Cost (DC)	N/A	Assumptions for Decommissioning Cost 
Total Lifecycle Cost (TLC)	TBD	Assumptions for Total Lifecycle Cost based on Implementation cost + yearly operating costs over the 10-year life span &#8211; will be adjusted once FMA approved costing received
Average Annual Lifecycle Costs (AALC)	TBD
	Assumption for Average Life Cycle Cost, based on a 10-year life span of the new solution &#8211; will be adjusted once FMA approved costing is received.

Benefits Analysis
This area will be completed once the FMA provides us the cost workbook for both ISB and IITB.

Preliminary Risk Identification
The following preliminary risks have been identified for this option: 
Source of Risk 	Risk Definition / Context 
Internal &#8211; Business Requirements	The existing solution may not have the capabilities to meet all standard business requirements as the internal processes mature.
Internal &#8211; Data migration	There is a risk that the fields created in SharePoint do not exist within the existing application and some data may be lost.
Internal &#8211; Loss of Data	There is a risk that data may be lost if issues occur with the existing legacy systems as they continue to age.
Internal &#8211; Impact on Business (change management)	Implementing new system changes will modify existing operational processes, embedded culture and may disrupt established networks for staff.
External &#8211; Interconnectivity	Program management between the TMB, BISB and the project-sponsoring branch must align to ensure interconnectivity between ongoing projects is in place.
External &#8211; Interoperability	The capabilities to link to other datasets, systems and their existing state may cause some dis-benefits or require major workarounds for business operations.
External &#8211; Stakeholder Engagement	Adopting an agile approach to support optimal documentation requires continued stakeholder involvement and is dependent on evolving priorities.

Implementation and Capacity Considerations
Stakeholder Impacts:
1.	ESDC and ISB will receive a positive impact from the increased efficiency in the handling of enforcement cases within the affected programs;
2.	Canadian Citizens will experience increased fairness due to the added investigational coverage and consistent delivery processes;
3.	IITB Development staff will be impacted by the retention of staff with the older skill set;
4.	ESDC Personnel &#8211; ISB-NHQ and regional staff will continue to use the existing application and may require additional training due to re-engineered business processes;
5.	ESDC personnel &#8211; Regional Integrity Operations will have a consistency in the delivery of modern services and processes;
6.	IITB Development staff will be impacted by the retention of programmer and systems analyst talent as a by-product of keeping the older systems and development languages; and
7.	Benefit Delivery Service Branch will be impacted by the reliability of data provided by the case management application and the improved service access.
&#8195;
Project Management Capacity:
Over the last fiscal year, ISB has created a PDO to centralize the function and to help increase its overall maturity level in PM. Specifically, for this project, ISB has assigned a Project Manager, two Deputy Project Managers, change management and business analysis staff to this effort. Between them, the project will have over thirty years of project experience and more than ten years of ISB experience. 
The project will be tracked using the ESDC PM framework, with the associated support from ESDC&#8217;s EPMO. ESDC executives will be kept informed of the project progress by monthly dashboard reporting and the necessary project-gating process.
The solution development will be undertaken by IITB, who will be assigning a technical manager to coordinate the development efforts. A project governance approach between IITB, ISB and regional executives will be implemented with a focus on team integration, transparency between enablers, and decisive issue resolution approach between responsible executives.
The solution will be developed using an Agile PM approach. The list of user requirements will be tracked and software development will occur during a series of &#8220;Sprints&#8221;. The length timeframes for each sprint will be defined by IITB and new software will be provided at the end of each sprint. Using an Agile process allows the development team to provide a solution quicker to the user community and tailor their development efforts on the most critical or required changes.
Lessons learned from the development and deployment of the TFWP/IMP ICMS system has, and will continue to be leveraged. One of the key project success points was the high integration between program, project and technical resources.
Based on the implementation and capacity listed above, the ability to implement the option is rated as High.
Organizational Readiness Analysis
The following concerns have been identified regarding readiness of ISB to adopt and take full advantage of this solution option:
Organizational Readiness Considerations
1.	ISB is currently executing an initiative to define the business model to process Enforcement cases;
2.	Involvement from the ISB regional community, with the ongoing enforcement project, has been at the levels and effort that ISB requires to complete the work. Regional and NHQ staff have bought into the proposed changes to support the new Enforcement model and ISB expects this level of commitment to continue;
3.	Within the ISB department, this project and associated Enforcement Maturity Model work, has a high priority and staff are available as required and sufficient funding is in place to support both efforts; and
4.	The ISB team has a dedicated Change Management group who will ensure that the end-user community will be informed of the proposed changes and will have the necessary training to support the system moving forward.

Based on the organizational readiness considerations above, the organizational readiness to adopt this option is rated as High.</div>
