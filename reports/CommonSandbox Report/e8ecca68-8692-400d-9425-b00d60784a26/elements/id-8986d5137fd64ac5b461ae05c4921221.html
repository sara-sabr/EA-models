Principle 1: client and service-centred design
GC solutions and services are designed from a client-centred and end-to-end digital service delivery perspective to increase the value they bring to clients through:
early user engagement
convenient access and availability through multiple channels
pre-population of information when possible and where appropriate
simplified, streamlined and joined-up workflows
reuse of information where appropriate
rigorous user testing

Principle 2: open
GC information and data is open by default, ensuring that:
information and data are made open to the public to the greatest extent possible
new processes are designed to enable and facilitate proactive release of government data and information by default
the public actively participates in policy, program and service design
citizens are consulted and engaged in government decisions and operations
GC employees work &#8220;in the open&#8221;

Principle 3: enterprise first
Departments will follow common standards, approaches and direction, and use existing enterprise assets, such as processes, data, contracts and solutions, as accelerators where:
information is created once, reused numerous times, and managed GC-wide as a single-aligned asset that is consistent, standardized and interoperable
solutions support the use of open standards, are scalable and can be rapidly deployed
cost-effective and efficient business solutions facilitate information and data integration, reuse, management, sharing and analytics
common business needs are addressed through enterprise or shared solutions, and departments stop investing in departmental legacy systems and refocus efforts, resources and funds on becoming ready to adopt an enterprise or shared solution and on accelerating its implementation
efforts across the GC are more coherent, integrated, secure and effective

Principle 4: secure
GC information is safeguarded for security, privacy and confidentiality, is monitored to prevent leaks, and is protected for future generations.

Principle 5: cloud first approach
Departments will explore &#8220;&#8230; as a service&#8221; (XaaS) cloud services before developing solutions in-house. This includes private and public cloud offerings.

Principle 6: enable a modern workplace: anywhere, anytime with anyone
The GC strives to be an innovative organization that:
provides its employees with modern technology that supports information retrieval, use, sharing and collaboration by making information and data accessible when and where needed
provides customizable tools and resources with minimized learning requirements for users
provides automated, digital processes in support of better services
attracts, retains and encourages public servants to work smarter and be innovative, greener and healthier so that they better serve Canadians

Early thinking on new digital principles is in progress in support of the shift to digital (see Appendix F).</div>
