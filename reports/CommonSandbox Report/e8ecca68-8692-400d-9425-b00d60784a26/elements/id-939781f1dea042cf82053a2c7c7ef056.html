Today&#8217;s digital landscape is marked by change of unprecedented pace and scope. Rapid technological, digital and data transformation are now part of Canadians&#8217; daily lives, revolutionizing the way they access information and services and the way they live, socialize and work.

Canadians expect to be able to access any government service, at any time and on any device. Most citizens agree that personal information should be shared between GC departments to enable faster, more accurate service.Footnote2 However, while they recognize the potential of technological, digital and data transformation, citizens are concerned about how the GC uses and manages their personal information and about what it does to ensure their privacy and security.Footnote3

In the 2020 Speech from the Throne, the government committed to ensuring that all Canadians, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed Internet. It also committed to making generational investments to update outdated IT systems to modernize the way government serves Canadians, from the elderly to the young, and from people looking for work to those living with a disability.

Canada plays a leadership role on digital government internationally, through forums such as the Digital Nations, the International Council for Information Technology in Government Administration (ICA), the Organisation for Economic Co&#8209;operation and Development (OECD), and the United Nations.

In recent years, Canada has also emerged as a leading voice in the global open government community. Since 2012, it has been a member of the Open Government Partnership (OGP). This multilateral initiative by 75 member nations and a number of sub&#8209;national government members aims to secure concrete commitments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance, in partnership with civil society and the private sector. So far, Canada has released three OGP action plans outlining how it will make government more open. A fourth action plan is under development.

The world is moving toward using cleaner technologies. The 2021&#8211;2024 DOSP goes hand in hand with the Greening Government Strategy, which seeks to make GC operations low-carbon through green procurement and clean technologies.</div>
