Principle:	Adoption of Event-Driven Architecture
Statement:	Preference will be given to event-driven architecture to help build decoupled, responsive, adaptive and resilient solutions.
Rationale: 	Modernization of digital channels and services, as well as planned advances in service delivery and common benefit processing, require ability to access data and process events and transactions in (near) real time. Solutions and services need to be designed to &#8220;react to events&#8221; and process them in (near) real time where desirable and to the extent possible.
This type of architecture adds a layer that further decouples architecture components, making the overall architecture more adaptive and resilient.
Implications:	&#8226;	Key objective is to move from batch to predominantly (near) real-time services and transactions.
&#8226;	Every integration should be considered for event driven approach. BDM will implement the most appropriate pattern for each integration with a view to move to event-driven integrations whenever this approach is aligned with the business processes the integration enables. 
&#8226;	We will assess supporting solutions and dependencies for their ability of being event driven and can participate without added complexity.
&#8226;	Best practices and lessons learned from previous successful implementations of these technologies will be consulted prior to making the decision.
&#8226;	We do not recommend &#8220;Everything is an Event&#8221; approach. Complementary integration patterns exist and will be considered for integrations that are not natively event-driven. Data integration technologies are available too!
&#8226;	Selection and implementation of an Event Broker and Messaging Platform becomes high priority for Tranche 1.
&#8226;	Caveat: C&#249;ram SPM includes OOTB batch processes that need to be implemented as defined by the platform. No previous implementations of C&#249;ram were based on event driven architecture.
&#8226;	Caveat: This type of architecture requires highly-available and resilient network and infrastructure. Cost may increase.
&#8226;	Caveat: Will require high transaction rate through SCED which raises performance and bandwidth concerns.


BDM EA WG: The principle is well received and supported by the architecture community. Despite caveats, this is a good principle to have to communicate desire to move from batch to predominantly real-time client services and transaction processing.
