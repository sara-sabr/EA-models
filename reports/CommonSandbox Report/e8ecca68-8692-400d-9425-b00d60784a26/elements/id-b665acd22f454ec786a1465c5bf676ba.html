Collect data from users only once and reuse wherever possible. Ensure that data is collected and held in a secure way so that it can easily be reused by others to provide services.

Guidance: Be good data stewards
Good data stewardship is required to ensure data is clean, reusable, and managed responsibly to be leveraged for data driven decision making and promote reuse of information rather than duplication of efforts.

This involves managing data and information responsibly and securely, which supports the sharing and reuse of data throughout the Government of Canada and through promoting its use through innovative new solutions within the private sector. In alignment with working in the open by default, data and information should be published to be readable, by humans or by machines by publishing well organized data in machine readable formats. In alignment with iterating and improving frequently, efforts should be made to continually improve the quality of the data, and the quality of the processes used to manage and publish said data. Further, by working in the open by default and properly managing data and information sources, issues such as duplication of data and information and rework can be mitigated, while promoting the creation of innovative solutions which are able to leverage information collected and published by the government. 

Aligned Behaviours
1. Our team strives to leverage data to continuously improve decision-making, operations, or service delivery.
2. Our team identifies what data is needed to support decision-making, operations, or service delivery and reuses existing data as appropriate before acquiring new data.
3. Our team strives to identify and remove barriers to data sharing and release.
4. Our team ensures that users of our services can make corrections to their personal information.
5. Our team publishes data and information on the open government portal.
6. Our team publishes data in plain language and machine-readable formats.
7. Our team has clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities for data and information management and use.
8. Our team captures appropriate metadata to provide context for the information and data we create and capture, thereby enabling its discovery and reuse by others.
9. Our team has processes in place to regularly assess, maintain, and improve data quality.
10. Our service has in place processes for ensuring proper management of information and data prior to being collected, used, disclosed, retained, disposed of, or declassified.
11. Our team ensures that information and data of business value are saved in systems where it can be properly managed.
12. Our team has processes in place for determining the classification of data and information.
13. Our team is aware of which information and data has business value and prioritizes its management.

Misaligned Behaviours
1. Our team, or the service our team manages, asks users for the same information more than once.
2. The service, or services, our team is responsible for collects all the data or information required without reusing existing data or information.
3. The documentation for our APIs is only available to internal approved consumers.
4. Our team does not have the data it needs to make informed policy, program, or service decisions.</div>
