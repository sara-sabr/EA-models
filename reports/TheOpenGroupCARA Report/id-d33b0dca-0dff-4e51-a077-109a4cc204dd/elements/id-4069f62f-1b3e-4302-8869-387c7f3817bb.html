						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">As in the case of pushback, anytime ground movement is initiated, permission must be received from the controlling authority. At some point before leaving the ramp area, the First Officer contacts ground control to get taxi clearance to the active runway. 
At this stage, any last minute changes (LMC) to the load sheet are received via ACARS or by radio. These may result in the reprogramming of affected parameters and too high take-off weight may dictate the request for a special runway which can result in a taxi and/or take-off delay while ATC works out a modified sequence. Once the load sheet information is processed, the crew completes the &#8220;taxi&#8221; and &#8220;before take-off&#8221; checklists. 
At some point, the Captain conducts a take-off briefing which includes which pilot will be making the take-off, initial heading, altitude and departure procedure requirements, obstacle clearance and noise abatement issues, airport elevation and the normal cleanup altitude. In addition, the briefing must address runway abort considerations, engine out procedures and associated cleanup altitudes, and emergency contingencies requiring returning to the departure point or other proximate landing options.   In situations where there will be a long taxi due to numerous departures ahead in sequence for take-off, it is desirable for the Captain to make a PA announcement informing the passengers and cabin crew of his/her best estimate of the length of the delay. This is typically done by counting the number of aircraft ahead in the take-off queue. If the delay is significant, the airline may have to be updated via ACARS or radio with a new ETD (estimated time of departure). As the aircraft approaches the departure end of the runway, the Captain makes a departure PA announcement to inform the flight attendants that the take-off is imminent and they should secure themselves at their stations. The Captain must assure that the passenger briefing has been completed, which may be a factor in short taxi-out situations.</div>
