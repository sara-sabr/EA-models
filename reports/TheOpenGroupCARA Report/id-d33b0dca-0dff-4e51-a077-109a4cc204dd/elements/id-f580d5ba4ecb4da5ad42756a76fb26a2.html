						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">IT Services is part of the Corporate Functions Capability (Domain). The following tasks are within the scope of this Capability (Group). It manages and controls Airline&#8217;s own equipment located at home and foreign airports. It provides services for communicating/interacting with external IT-services and third party services/IT systems are made available for the Airline&#8217;s own processes. It is responsible for the management of interfaces to third party systems, for example interfaces to luggage distribution and routing systems of other Airlines. Furthermore it provides a middleware, messaging, enterprise service bus (ESB) and provides an infrastructure that supports the usual communication patterns: request/response, pub/sub, etc. Lastly, it provides the Enterprise Application Integration facilities.
This sub domain shall be more technical oriented and therefore it shall not implement business services but basic services used by several other domains. Knowing that the difference between technical and business services is somehow difficult to determine, Enterprise Architecture Management is a crucial part for each organization.

User Data Management
Establish central / group-wide data access to customer data: A central user data model and a common storage of user data does not imply sharing of airline related customer to the group. Governance of identity and access management to common user data storage is a prerequisite for this concept.
User Data Management aims to derive high-level target user data model from CUSTIS and SAMBA, gather requirements from airline-individual personalization initiatives and to use existing customer data where available. Recognize personalization initiatives supporting the idea of customer centricity: Personalization depends, simply spoken, on available information in a specific context (service). A common user data model should include all information which will be useful to provide personalized services.</div>
