						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Crew Management is a sub domain of the Flight Ops domain. Crew related costs are second only to fuel costs, typically accounting for about 10% - 20% of an airline's cost base.  With such a large amount of money being spent on crew, even small improvements can result in significant savings. Of the several buckets that make up crew costs, crew supply chain performance (movement of crew from upstream manpower planning process to training, scheduling and tracking along with its critical interdependencies) is perhaps the only area which can be significantly optimized without pain. Schedule changes, both voluntary and involuntary, make the best laid out plan go awry resulting in inefficiencies in crew supply chain (swing from too many crew to too few). This leads to avoidable hidden costs and revenue leakages.
The following tasks are within the scope of this sub domain. It defines company recruiting standards (soft and hard facts) for cockpit instruction &amp; ready entries and cabin). Defines marketing for recruiting. Executes recruiting process. It also derives crew demand from network capacity planning. This sub domain optimizes costs for crew under consideration of overall network in crew-pairing step. Furthermore it maps actual crews against each pairing in crew-rostering step. Considers legal restrictions, crew training and preferences from crew staff. It also ensures crew licensing and provides crew information. Crew Management is responsible for crew training management (simulator planning, cabin training, qualification request management) and crew monitoring and tracking, irregularities handling (e.g. check of crew duty limitations in terms of legal operation). Lastly, it is responsible for the communication with Crews, e.g. via crew portals and the preparation of all crew related dispatch activities.</div>
