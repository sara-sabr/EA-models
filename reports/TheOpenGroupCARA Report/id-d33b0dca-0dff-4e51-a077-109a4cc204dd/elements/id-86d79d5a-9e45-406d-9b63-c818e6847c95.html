						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">In order to make most efficient use of runway resources, the local tower controller often issues a &#8220;position and hold&#8221; clearance to an aircraft in preparation for final take-off clearance. This allows the aircraft to taxi into position and hold on the departure runway while waiting for other traffic, runway restrictions or an ATC issued departure time. If this hold time is not required or a departure needs to be expedited, the tower may clear the flight for take-off without holding in position. At this time the crew makes final checks of the wind/weather and the presence of runway contamination. If the flight is following the departure of a large aircraft, adequate wake separation requirements must be assured by confirming that an acceptable interval of time has elapsed before commencing the take-off roll.
Once the take-off clearance is received, the pilots&#8217; roles of Captain/First Officer change to pilot-flying/pilot not-flying (PF/PNF) in order to accomplish the procedures commensurate with which pilot is flying the leg. At all times, however, the Captain is still pilot-in-command (PIC) and, since he/she remains responsible for the flight and may choose to assume the PF role at his/her discretion. Certain weather conditions (low visibility) or crew experience levels may dictate that the Captain remain PF during some or all of the flight.
During the take-off roll, the crew monitors the aircraft centerline tracking, engine parameters, and conditions both inside and outside of the aircraft. The PNF calls out each V-speed as part of the normal procedure. Should a critical problem occur before the abort decision speed, V1, the take-off is rejected and the aircraft is stopped on the runway.
An uneventful take-off is followed by a normal initial climb-out which includes &#8220;cleaning up&#8221; the aircraft (gear raised, flaps/slats retracted) while conforming to any noise and/or obstacle requirements.</div>
