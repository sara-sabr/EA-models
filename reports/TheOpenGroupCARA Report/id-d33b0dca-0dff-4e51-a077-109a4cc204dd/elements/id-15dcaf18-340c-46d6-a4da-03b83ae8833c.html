						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">The pilots use taxiway charts of the destination airport to assist in the execution of taxi clearances given to them by ATC. Pilots must be diligent during ground operations at airports with which they are unfamiliar or that are undergoing construction. Operations during nighttime or heavy precipitation also require special consideration and may substantially impede the overall traffic movement on the airfield. At some point during taxi-in the Captain determines the necessity of starting the APU. In the interest of fuel conservation, an engine may be shutdown which may require utilizing the APU, depending on the aircraft type. Normally the APU is started while the aircraft is a few minutes from the gate area, unless it has been determined that ground power will be used. In that case, the APU is not started and an engine is left running after gate arrival until the ground electric is connected by the guide crew.
If the arrival gate is occupied, the aircraft may be required to wait out the delay at a remote location. Occupied gates are often the result of a delayed departure or other operational issues with the aircraft currently positioned at the gate and the anticipated delay should be passed on to ATC and the passengers. Once clearance to the gate is received, the Captain taxis to the ramp area and visually acquires the marshallers. After the crew confirms the gate area is unobstructed, the marshallers utilize lighted wands to signal clearance to taxi to the stop point adjacent to the jetbridge. Often delays are encountered at this point due to the unavailability of the ground crew, carts or vehicular traffic in the gate area, or a tow-in requirement for the assigned gate (in which the aircraft engines are shut down and a tug is used to tow the aircraft onto the gate position). Some stations utilize automatic parking systems which employ an arrangement of lights and/or signs that the Captain uses for lead-in line and stopping position guidance. In the absence of self-guidance, the marshaller uses wand signals to direct and stop the aircraft at the desired location. Once the brakes are parked, the agent moves the jetbridge into position at the entry door, or in the case of airstair disembarkation, positions the truck(s) under the appropriate exit door(s).</div>
