						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Once the agent moves the jetbridge out of the way, the pushback crew advises the cockpit that the wheel chocks are removed and that it is safe to release the parking brake. The Captain acknowledges release of the parking brake and signals the First Officer to call ramp control (or ATC, depending on local requirements) for pushback clearance. Usually, the cockpit crew is advised by the pushback crew that the area is clear for engine start.
Under certain weather conditions, ice or frost may be present on the airframe or airfoil surfaces which require removal before take-off. In situations where deicing or anti-icing is required, the Captain delays the engine start while the push crew positions the aircraft in a designated de-ice location. At many airports, secondary de-icing locations are established nearer to the departure runway in order to keep the time to take-off below the holdover time. The holdover time is the length of time (in minutes) that the anti-icing fluid is effective and is determined by the flight crew from tables in their flight manuals. The time may vary according to temperature, type and intensity of precipitation, and type and concentration of fluid used. Once the anti-ice application is complete, the icing coordinator advises the cockpit crew when the holdover time begins. It is then the responsibility of the Captain to monitor the holdover time vs. take-off time. If the delay before take-off is too long, the aircraft may have to return to a de-icing location to be re-treated.
After the engines are started and the towbar is disconnected, the Captain gives the guideman permission to disconnect the interphone headset. The guideman then steps into a position where he is visible from the flight deck, shows the nulling pin (used to disable the aircraft&#8217;s nosewheel steering system during pushback) and gives a salute which confirms the ramp area is clear to taxi. The Captain acknowledges the salute and the First Officer calls for taxi clearance. Once clearance is received, the Captain begins the taxi-out only after both pilots have visually checked outside and verbally announced &#8220;clear left&#8221; and &#8220;clear right&#8221;.</div>
