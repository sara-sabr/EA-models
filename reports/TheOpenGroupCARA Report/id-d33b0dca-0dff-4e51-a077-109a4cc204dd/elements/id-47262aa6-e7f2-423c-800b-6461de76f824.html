						<div class="convertlinks documentation" style="white-space:pre-wrap">Upon completion of postflight duties at the aircraft, the cockpit crew accomplishes any required debrief reports while the flight attendants make liquor and duty-free deposits, usually at the station operations. Debriefs/reports are required by the cockpit crew in instances of a declared emergency or ATC violation, significant mechanical failures (including engine shutdown), fuel dumping, illness, injury or death of a passenger or crew member, passenger misconduct/smoking, overweight landing, HAZMAT issues, diversions, high speed aborts, lightning strikes, near midair collisions and a number of other situations involving non-standard operations or issues. Once all cockpit and cabin obligations are fulfilled, the crew begins preparations for the next flight leg. In situations where the same aircraft is to be used, a new flight plan is pulled up and the pre-flight sequence starts all over. In most cases, however, the crew must change aircraft and relocate to the new departure gate where the planning/preflight duties are repeated. If this is the last flight of the day, the crew is released from duty and typically proceeds to the crew hotel limo in cases of out of base layovers, or the bus to the employee parking lot if the inbound flight was the last leg of a sequence.
If the aircraft is to be &#8220;turned around&#8221; for use in a subsequent leg, maintenance personnel will attempt to meet the flight upon gate arrival. Any discrepancies are discussed with the inbound flight crew and the necessary repairs are begun as soon as possible. If the discrepancy has been reported in in-flight, the mechanics often meet the aircraft with replacement parts such as Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) which can often allow repair in the normally-scheduled turn-around window. If the aircraft is not to be used right away, required maintenance may be performed during periods of less demand. In situations where the aircraft is finished for the day, it may be towed or taxied to a remote location, or the hangar, where the requisite maintenance and/or inspections are completed. In addition to maintenance requirements, other post-flight activity conducted by ground personnel include aircraft cleaning and de-catering, security checks and any required customs inspections. When customs or security inspections are required, delays are often incurred since the outbound crew cannot access the aircraft until the inspection is complete. In any event, it is desirable from an efficiency standpoint that ground service activities associated with the inbound flight such as catering, cleaning, and baggage handling should dovetail with the departure cycles of subsequent flight legs.</div>
