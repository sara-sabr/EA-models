        <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Interoperable Digital Public Services Implementation Orientation ABB is a Business Object setting decision making rules/criteria/principles followed at implementing a digital public services through organisations, persons, objects or events &#xD;
&#xD;
The following implementation orientations are identified in the literature: integration, technology, governance and legal.&#xD;
&#xD;
•	The INTEGRATION ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on data resources and on information management capabilities to manage information resources over their life cycle (i.e. scanning, collecting, organising, processing, maintaining, etc.) to understand societal needs, to embed data throughout the policy cycle, and to develop a culture of data analytics (OECD, 2018). The integration orientation will be based on semantic interoperability aiming for the design of a shared knowledge base of usable data, information and knowledge resources that enables:&#xD;
i)	structural interoperability by using and/or sharing of data, organisational information and organisational knowledge (i.e. data set catalogue, base registries, catalogue of ontologies); &#xD;
ii)	behavioural interoperability by exchanging capabilities of data, organisational information and organisational knowledge with the environment (i.e. representation, data mappings); and&#xD;
iii)	governance interoperability by semantic interoperability agreements (i.e. ontologies).  &#xD;
&#xD;
•	The TECHNOLOGY ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on ICT resources like solutions and infrastructure and on ICT management capabilities to manage the provision of services (i.e. business operations, decision making, internal support, etc.) to users and the consumption of services by ministries and agencies (OECD, 2018). The technology orientation will be based on technical interoperability aiming for the design of a shared platform of ICT resources (i.e. the platform) that enables:&#xD;
i) structural interoperability by reusing and/or sharing of software components (i.e. service registry service, networks, reusable building blocks, common [back office] services);&#xD;
ii) behavioural interoperability with ICT exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. intermediation services, interfaces); an&#xD;
iii) governance interoperability with technical interoperability agreements (i.e. protocols, choreography rules).&#xD;
&#xD;
•	The GOVERNANCE ORIENTATION (Marchand et al., 2000) is characterized by a focus on the governance resources (Grant et al., 2007) and on governance management capabilities/archetypes to manage the effective use of information (i.e. sharing, security, privacy, etc.) for the effective use of information (i.e. sharing, security, privacy, etc.) to achieve a more agile, effective, and digitally inclusive public engagement, to increase trust in government, and to enhance government transparency (OECD, 2018; Weill &amp; Woodham, 2002). The governance orientation will be based on organisational interoperability aiming for the design of a shared governance framework of [re]usable organisational resources that enables:&#xD;
i)	structural interoperability by reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. public services catalogue);&#xD;
ii)	behavioural interoperability with organisational exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. service delivery model); and&#xD;
iii)	governance interoperability with organisational interoperability agreements (i.e. service level agreements, governance structures).&#xD;
&#xD;
•	The LEGAL ORIENTATION (Santosuossa and Malerba, 2014) is characterized by a focus on legal and regulatory frameworks based in displayed leadership and political commitment to ensure adaptation to rapidly changing technological and diverse social environments with high-level requirements to achieve coherence and effective support to digital public services implementation (OECD, 2018). The legal orientation will be based in legal interoperability aiming for the design of a shared legal framework of [re]usable legal resources that enables:&#xD;
i)	structural interoperability by legislation on reusing and/or sharing orientation and guidelines (i.e. legislation catalogue, interoperability reference architectures);&#xD;
ii)	behavioural interoperability by legislation on exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. interoperability frameworks); and&#xD;
iii)	governance interoperability by legislation on governance agreements (i.e. GDPR).&#xD;

        <documentation>Digital Encoding of Characters. To be of any use in computers, in computer communications and in particular on the World Wide Web, characters must be encoded. In fact, much of the information processed by computers over the last few decades has been encoded text, exceptions being images, audio, video and numeric data. To achieve text encoding, a large variety of character encodings have been devised. Character encodings can loosely be explained as mappings between the character sequences that users manipulate and the sequences of bits that computers manipulate.&#xD;

Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-8)&#xD;
&#xD;
ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.  The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8.&#xD;
UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values.&#xD;
UTF-8 has a one-octet encoding unit.  It uses all bits of an octet, but has the quality of preserving the full US-ASCII [US-ASCII] range: US-ASCII characters are encoded in one octet having the normal US-ASCII value, and any octet with such a value can only stand for a US-ASCII character, and nothing else.&#xD;
UTF-8 encodes UCS characters as a varying number of octets, where the number of octets, and the value of each, depend on the integer value assigned to the character in ISO/IEC 10646 (the character number, a.k.a. code position, code point or Unicode scalar value).&#xD;

UUID&#xD;
A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs. Since a UUID is a fixed size and contains a time field, it is possible for values to rollover.  A UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network. The internal representation of a UUID is a specific sequence of bits in memory, as described in Section 4.  To accurately represent a UUID as a URN, it is necessary to convert the bit sequence to a string representation. Each field is treated as an integer and has its value printed as a zero-filled hexadecimal digit string with the most significant digit first.  The hexadecimal values &quot;a&quot; through &quot;f&quot; are output as lower case characters and are case insensitive on input.&#xD;

Guidelines for Dublin Core Application Profiles : date and language&#xD;
date: Because we want to perform automated operations like sorting on the date, we can select the Dublin Core property dcterms:date. This property can take a string value. We can indicate that the value string is formatted in accordance with the W3C Date and Time Formats specification by using syntax encoding scheme dcterms:W3CDTF.&#xD;
language: The language needs to be selected from a controlled list. We achieve this by requiring the use of three-letter codes listed in the international standard ISO 639-3 for the representation of names of languages (such as &quot;&quot;eng&quot;&quot; for &quot;&quot;English&quot;&quot;) together with the syntax encoding scheme dcterms:ISO639-3 as a datatype. For this, we can use the DCMI property dcterms:language, which can accommodate either an identifier for the language term or a string.&#xD;

&#xD;
Step 1: Source System Details&#xD;
OCDS data may originate in multiple source systems, therefore it is important to record the details of the source system we are mapping from. &#xD;
Step 2: Source Field Details&#xD;
Using the (Source) Fields sheet, populate the following information for each field in the source table: the system the field is from (as recorded in step 1); the table in which the field is located; the field title.&#xD;
Where additional context is required you may also record a narrative description of the source field in the description field and it might also be useful to add an example of the value that the field takes alongside further technical information on the type and multiplicity of the field.&#xD;
Step 3: Mapping&#xD;
The mapping template has a sheet for each stage of the contracting process, from (OCDS) 2. Planning through to (OCDS) 6. Implementation, with details of the relevant fields from the OCDS schema, in addition to the (OCDS) 1. General (all stages) sheet which contains fields relevant to all stages of the contracting process. Review each of the (OCDS) sheets in the mapping template to identify fields in the OCDS schema to which a field in the source system can be mapped. &#xD;
Step 4: Review&#xD;
Repeat steps 1-3 for all tables and all source systems to complete the mapping.&#xD;
Gaps in currently held data: if you identify data OCDS requests, but that you do not hold, engage with data users to consider whether this additional data could and should be provided.&#xD;
Gaps in OCDS: you might have data which is not covered by OCDS. In these cases, talk with the OCDS helpdesk to see whether this should be included in an extension to the standard. Additional fields can be documented at the bottom of each mapping sheet in the template.&#xD;

AS4 Profile specification&#xD;
The eDelivery AS4 Profile is a modular profile of the ebMS3 and AS4 OASIS specifications. Its core is a mandatory Common Profile that selects, extends and profiles the AS4 ebHandler Conformance Profile and AS4 Additional Features and provides a common Usage Profile. This Common Profile can be implemented using open source or closed source AS4 software implementations. It is aligned with, and corresponds to a subset of, the AS4 profile for TSOs (Transmission System Operators) developed by ENTSOG (the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas).&#xD;
In addition to the Common Profile, this specification provides a number of optional Profile Enhancement modules that specify functionality enhancements covering AS4 message exchange in four corner topologies, the use of AS4 in conjunction with the UN/CEFACT Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) specification, and Dynamic Receiver and Dynamic Sender behavior.&#xD;

Reference Data Policy ABB is a Business Object being applied to data used to organise or categorise other data, or for relating data to information both within and beyond the boundaries of the enterprise. Usually it mandates the use of codes and descriptions, or definitions.

Source: DAMA DM_BOK
(http://www.dama.org)

Reference data consists typically of a small, discrete set of values that are not updated as part of business transactions but are usually used to impose consistent classiﬁcation. Reference data normally has a low update frequency. Reference data is relevant across more than one business systems belonging to different organisations and sectors 
[Source: J. Jordan &amp; C. Ellen (2009). Business need, data and business intelligence].

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:&#xD;
IoP Dimension: Governance IoP 
The Reference Data Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because Reference Data can be shared and reused (e.g. in the form of taxonomies or controlled vocabularies) between organisation to agree on some  basic information. Management of reference data is a priority as suggested by EIF's recommendation 31: &quot;Put in place an information management strategy at the highest possible level to avoid fragmentation and duplication. Management of metadata, master data and reference data should be prioritised.&quot;

Documents are stored in different formats: pdf format (if available in paper form only and subsequently digitised) or word, excel, tif, rtf, html, txt version (if received as such or produced by DG Competition). CMAfx contains also procedural steps and case information, such as the composition of the case team, relevant legal basis, type of case, priority, name of undertaking concerned etc. Access to CMAfx is restricted to DG Competition personnel and national experts on secondment using DG Competition IT infrastructure. The undertakings answering the queries are obliged to indicate the confidentiality status of their responses, i.e., whether their answer must be treated as confidential, and in that case the system does not allow submission of their responses until a non-confidential answer has been provided for each confidential one. The non-confidential versions of the Commission's decisions adopted pursuant to articles 7-10, 23 and 24 of Regulation 1/2003 are published on DG Competition website, after the confidentiality claims (with regard to business secrets and other confidential information) were cleared with the respective parties. &#xD;

e-procurement SAT - Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement&#xD;
DIRECTIVE 2014/24/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC (Text with EEA relevance). The directive sets out rules on the use of public contracts for the provision of works, supplies or services by companies or individuals and the exemptions which can be applied. The legislation specifies that when national authorities use public procurement to invite tenders to provide works, supplies or services, they must treat all applicants equally and not discriminate between them. They must also be transparent in their dealings. This Directive is considered as a Legal Interoperability Specification, as it shall be transposed in a National or Regional Binding Instrument when designing the solution using the e-procurement Solution Architecture Template.&#xD;

1.	A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities. Union action, which shall complement national policies, shall be directed towards improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness and diseases, and obviating sources of danger to physical and mental health. Such action shall cover the fight against the major health scourges, by promoting research into their causes, their transmission and their prevention, as well as health information and education, and monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health. The Union shall complement the Member States' action in reducing drugs-related health damage, including information and prevention.&#xD;
2.	The Union shall encourage cooperation between the Member States in the areas referred to in this Article and, if necessary, lend support to their action. It shall in particular encourage cooperation between the Member States to improve the complementarity of their health services in cross-border areas. Member States shall, in liaison with the Commission, coordinate among themselves their policies and programmes in the areas referred to in paragraph 1. The Commission may, in close contact with the Member States, take any useful initiative to promote such coordination, in particular initiatives aiming at the establishment of guidelines and indicators, the organisation of exchange of best practice, and the preparation of the necessary elements for periodic monitoring and evaluation. The European Parliament shall be kept fully informed.&#xD;
3.	The Union and the Member States shall foster cooperation with third countries and the competent international organisations in the sphere of public health.&#xD;
4.	By way of derogation from Article 2(5) and Article 6(a) and in accordance with Article 4(2)(k) the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, shall contribute to the achievement of the objectives referred to in this Article through adopting in order to meet common safety concerns: (a) measures setting high standards of quality and safety of organs and substances of human origin, blood and blood derivatives; these measures shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures; (b) measures in the veterinary and phytosanitary fields which have as their direct objective the protection of public health; (c) measures setting high standards of quality and safety for medicinal products and devices for medical use.&#xD;
5.	The European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, may also adopt incentive measures designed to protect and improve human health and in particular to combat the major cross-border health scourges, measures concerning monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health, and measures which have as their direct objective the protection of public health regarding tobacco and the abuse of alcohol, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States.&#xD;
6.	The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may also adopt recommendations for the purposes set out in this Article.&#xD;
7.	Union action shall respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the definition of their health policy and for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. The responsibilities of the Member States shall include the management of health services and medical care and the allocation of the resources assigned to them. The measures referred to in paragraph 4(a) shall not affect national provisions on the donation or medical use of organs and blood.&#xD;

EURES - Job vacancy&#xD;
Most of the jobs on the EURES Job Mobility Portal come from the job vacancies databases managed by the Public Employment Services of the countries participating in EURES. Using a technology called Web Services, the EURES search engine instantly, in real time, interrogates each national database for jobs. These jobs can be of two types:&#xD;
“EURES jobs&quot;, displayed with a blue flag, which are jobs where an employer has expressed an interest in recruiting from another country, or any other jobs advertised in the national jobs databases.&#xD;
There is, in addition, a central database where EURES advisers can manually post jobs that will all be flagged as &quot;EURES jobs&quot;. This is for the time being the only way for those few countries that are not yet fully connected to Web Services to advertise jobs on the EURES portal. This solution can, however, also be used for other specific purposes, such as when an employer wishes to publish a vacancy in several languages etc., which may not always be possible in a national database.&#xD;

EUCARIS - registry network&#xD;
EUCARIS is an initiative of several European countries and can be described as a cooperation between several national registration authorities. Formalised in a multilateral treaty, this cooperation is focused on the data-exchange regarding vehicle registration, driving licences, and the accompanying personal data. For this exchange, a system is used which was especially developed for this purpose: EUCARIS II. It is essential to note that EUCARIS makes no use of a central European database. Each country is responsible for its own registry of vehicle and driving licence information and its own registration procedures. Through their national registration authority other government institutions can request information on e.g. vehicles from another country. The national registration authority becomes a central hub in EUCARIS.&#xD;

The Descriptive Metadata Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because metadata facilitates opening and sharing data by providing the appropriate format, description of the content, high level of quality in order to achieve interoperability as stated in the EIF recommendation n° 42: &quot;[..] Ensure that open data is accompanied by high quality, machine-readable metadata in non-proprietary formats, including a description of their content, the way data is collected and its level of quality and the licence terms under which it is made available. The use of common vocabularies for expressing metadata is recommended.&quot;

Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1: Reference Description&#xD;
The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is a vocabulary of fifteen properties for use in resource description. The name &quot;Dublin&quot; is due to its origin at a 1995 invitational workshop in Dublin, Ohio; &quot;core&quot; because its elements are broad and generic, usable for describing a wide range of resources.&#xD;
The fifteen element &quot;Dublin Core&quot; described in this standard is part of a larger set of metadata vocabularies and technical specifications maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI). The full set of vocabularies, DCMI Metadata Terms [DCMI-TERMS], also includes sets of resource classes (including the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCMI-TYPE]), vocabulary encoding schemes, and syntax encoding schemes. The terms in DCMI vocabularies are intended to be used in combination with terms from other, compatible vocabularies in the context of application profiles and on the basis of the DCMI Abstract Model [DCAM].&#xD;

e-Justice Portal - Commission's approach on the security of communication and information systems in the European Commission
Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2017/46 of 10 January 2017 on the security of communication and information systems in the European Commission. The Commission's approach should take into account EU policy initiatives and legislation on network and information security, industry standards and good practices, to comply with all relevant legislation and to allow interoperability and compatibility.  This decision applies to all communication and information systems (CISs) which are owned, procured, managed or operated by or on behalf of the Commission and all usage of those CISs by the Commission.
This decision sets out the basic principles, objectives, organisation and responsibilities regarding the security of those CISs, and in particular for Commission departments owning, procuring, managing or operating CISs and including CISs provided by an internal IT service provider.

Data Policy ABB is a Business Object being applied to a trusted authentic source of information under the control of an appointed public administration or organisation appointed by government.

According to the European Interoperability Framework, base registries are: “reliable sources of basic information on items such as persons, companies, vehicles, licenses, buildings, locations and roads” and “are authentic and authoritative and form, separately or in combination, the cornerstone of public services”.

The Base Registry Data Policy ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because base registries include &quot;authorative sources of information&quot;, that need to be properly governed and made available. EIF's includes base registries in the conceptual model for integrated public services, and describes it as &quot;the cornerstone of European public service delivery&quot;. EIF gives several recommendations on how to manage and interact with base registries (recommendation 37, 38, 39 and 40).

GOOD PRACTICES ON BUILDING SUCESSFUL INTERCONNECTIONS OF BASE REGISTRIES&#xD;
In order to provide quick and user-friendly public services to citizens and businesses, public administrations are trying to adopt customer-centric approaches and readjust their ways of working.&#xD;
One way to achieve efficiency and increase user-friendliness is through the ‘once-only principle’. Instead of asking the citizen for information that they have already provided, public administrations will reuse the information they already have. Much of this information is stored in authoritative databases called base registries. As the authentic sources of data for public administrations, base registries are one of the basic building blocks of public services and are the key to making the once-only principle a reality.&#xD;
The document contains some good practices to foster access to the data contained in these base registries.&#xD;
The good practices presented, are grouped according to the layered interoperability model proposed by the European Interoperability&#xD;
Framework (EIF).&#xD;

The Competent Body is the independent organisation responsible for assessing, awarding, and managing EU Ecolabel applications and licences on the national level. The Competent Body provides guidance on the documents needed for the dossier, such as declarations, data sheets, and test results. Recommendations on product testing laboratories that are ISO 17025 accredited or equivalent are shared, along with any relevant technical expertise needed to complete the application.&#xD;
Upon application approval, the Competent Body issues the contract and licence upon approving the application. This contract sets out the services or range of products covered within the licence, including any trade names or manufacturer’s internal reference numbers. It will also lay out the terms of use of the EU Ecolabel, following the standard contract in Annex IV of the Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 of 25 November 2009. Once the contract has been signed, a certificate can be asked for/will be sent, depending on the Competent Body. This certificate will detail: the licence number that can be used with the EU Ecolabel logo; the legal name of the applicant; the services or range of products awarded the EU Ecolabel; all relevant trade names under which the product is sold or the service is marketed. The Competent Body will give the final validation on when the EU Ecolabel logo and the licence number can be used on the EU Ecolabel services and products that have met the criteria.&#xD;

It is a legal resource on governance rules enabling collaboration between digital public services cross legal jurisdictions.  Generally speaking it is of a generic not binding nature like the declarations  of Tallinn and Berlin (typically involving many legal jurisdictions). Legal agreements of binding nature typically take the form of binding legal acts like the reference list of offences punishable in the European arrest warrant (2002/584/JHA: Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002).  &#xD;

An example of a treaty that does have provisions for further binding agreements is the UN Charter. By signing and ratifying the Charter, countries agreed to be legally bound by resolutions passed by UN bodies such as the General Assembly and the Security Council. Thus, UN resolutions are legally binding on UN Member States, and no signature or ratification is necessary.</documentation>

The framework gives specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services. It offers public administrations 47 concrete recommendations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities, establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital services, and ensure that both existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability efforts. The new EIF is undertaken in the context of the Commission priority to create a Digital Single Market in Europe. The public sector, which accounts for over a quarter of total employment and represents approximately a fifth of the EU’s GDP through public procurement, plays a key role in the Digital Single Market as a regulator, services provider and employer. The successful implementation of the EIF will improve the quality of European public services and will create an environment where public administrations can collaborate digitally.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The EU cybersecurity certification framework - The European Commission puts forward the creation of a EU certification framework for ICT security products in its 2017 proposal for a regulation. - On 13 September 2017 the Commission issued a proposal for a regulation on ENISA, the &quot;&quot;EU Cybersecurity Agency&quot;&quot;, and on Information and Communication Technology cybersecurity certification (''Cybersecurity Act''). Certification plays a critical role in increasing trust and security in products and services that are crucial for the digital single market. At the moment, a number of different security certification schemes for ICT products exist in the EU. Without a common framework for EU-wide valid cybersecurity certificates, there is an increasing risk of fragmentation and barriers in the single market. The proposed certification framework will provide EU-wide certification schemes as a comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures. This will be based on agreement at EU level for the evaluation of the security properties of a specific ICT-based product or service e.g. smart cards. The certification will attest that ICT products and services that have been certified in accordance with such a scheme comply with specified cybersecurity requirements. The resulting certificate will be recognized in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for purchasers to understand the security features of the product or service. The schemes proposed in the future European framework will rely as much as possible on international standards as a way to avoid creating trade barriers and ensuring coherence with international initiatives.&quot;

Certification plays a critical role in increasing trust and security in products and services that are crucial for the digital single market. At the moment, a number of different security certification schemes for ICT products exist in the EU. Without a common framework for EU-wide valid cybersecurity certificates, there is an increasing risk of fragmentation and barriers in the single market. The proposed certification framework will provide EU-wide certification schemes as a comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures. This will be based on agreement at EU level for the evaluation of the security properties of a specific ICT-based product or service e.g. smart cards. The certification will attest that ICT products and services that have been certified in accordance with such a scheme comply with specified cybersecurity requirements. The resulting certificate will be recognized in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for purchasers to understand the security features of the product or service. The schemes proposed in the future European framework will rely as much as possible on international standards as a way to avoid creating trade barriers and ensuring coherence with international initiatives.&quot;"/>

      <documentation>Definition: Digital-ready Policymaking ABB is a Business Process consisting in formulating digital-ready policies and legislation by considering digital aspects from the start of the policy cycle to ensure that they are ready for the digital age, future-proof and interoperable.

Source: Joinup (Digital Ready Policies)

Source reference: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/better-legislation-smoother-implementation/digital-ready-policymaking

Synonym: Policy Cycle

Additional information: Policies (and legislative acts) are digital-ready if they enable smooth and digital by default policy implementation and foster digital transformation through best use of digital technologies and data. This implies that policymakers work in a multidisciplinary team and consider the following digital-ready components: 1. user-centric processes ready for automation, 2. alignment with digital policies (for example on accessibility, eID...), 3. the once-only principle and the reuse of data, 4. the evolving ICT landscape, 5. innovation and digital technologies, and 6. digital-ready drafting.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Performance-based Full Policy Cycle for the Digital Single Market (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2013/507457/IPOL-IMCO_ET(2013)507457_EN.pdf). The key features of a performance-based full policy cycle are a clear articulation of policy objectives, the identification and use of quantitative indicators of expected short-term and longer-term policy impacts, the identification of synergies between policies, a much greater use of quantitative data in ex-ante impact assessments, the implementation of robust, data-based, independent ex post assessments of the performance of policies relative to their expected impacts and a wide dissemination of lessons learned in such ex-post performance assessments

IoP Dimension: Governance IoP

LOST view: Legal view

Interoperability saliency: The Public Policy Cycle ABB is salient for the governance  interoperability because it impacts on the design and formulation of public policies, which are implemented through legal acts. Also, the ABB also is salient for the legal interoperability due to it establis the legal actions and directives for public administration services as the case of interoperability principles need to be taken into account during the whole public policy cycle.

      <documentation>Definition: Data Owner ABB is a Business Role being assigned to individual who creates or generates the data or the entity that has legal ownership or control over the data. In other cases, a data owner might be the individual or entity that is responsible for managing or overseeing the use of the data. It can be mapped with Data Controller from the GDPR, under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a &quot;data controller&quot; is defined as the entity that determines the purposes, conditions, and means of the processing of personal data. This means that the data controller is the entity that decides why and how personal data is processed.

Source: GDPR

Source reference: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj

Synonym: Data Holder (DGA), Data Creator (SiMPL)

Additional information: Data owners may not work with their data every day, but are responsible for overseeing and protecting a data domain. In the context of the GDPR, data owners are accountable for the quality, integrity, and protection of their data space. In SiMPL (https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/simpl-cloud-edge-federations-and-data-spaces-made-simple), the data owner is the legal entity that has sovereignty over the data, usually the creator of the data or the one who executes control over the data. See SiMPL requirements and architecture vision document. The Data Governance Act does not define the concept Data Owner, but intrinsically this role can be assigned also to the Data Holder, since &quot;holding&quot; usually entails &quot;controlling&quot;.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): In the GDPR, &quot;controller&quot;, or &quot;processor&quot; on behalf of the &quot;controller&quot; are examples of the data owner role defined for this ABB. See GDPR https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN , Article 4, Definitions.

IoP Dimension: Behavioural IoP, Governance IoP

LOST view: Organisational view

Interoperability saliency: The Data Owner ABB is salient for organisational interoperability because it is responsible for the management of the data generated or consumed by the public service. The identification of Data Owners, as stated in the GDPR, is important for accountability since it identifies a person/team responsible to control the compliance of data, and for the definition of policies and standards for the alignment of public service data to GDPR.

Additional information: Generally speaking a Legal Agreement Contract t is of a generic not binding nature like the declarations of Tallinn and Berlin (typically involving many legal jurisdictions). Legal agreements of binding nature typically take the form of binding legal acts like the reference list of offences punishable in the European arrest warrant (2002/584/JHA: Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002).

Example: An example of a treaty that does have provisions for further binding agreements is the UN Charter. By signing and ratifying the Charter, countries agreed to be legally bound by resolutions passed by UN bodies such as the General Assembly and the Security Council. Thus, UN resolutions are legally binding on UN Member States, and no signature or ratification is necessary. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiA3djvvbT2AhX1SPEDHdmuCqMQFnoECAYQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.phe.gov%2Fs3%2Flaw%2FPages%2FInternational.aspx&amp;usg=AOvVaw23fJMEr0G7JOPyleNl2lrd

Framework Agreement ABB is a Contract providing an arrangement between one or more entity that provide the terms governing contracts to be established for a certain period of time, in particular with regard to price and, where necessary, the quantity envisaged. Other repetitive conditions known in advance, such as the place of delivery, may be included. They are also called blanket purchase agreements and master ordering agreements. Essentially, they are intended to provide expeditious ordering of commonly used, off-the-shelf goods, purchased on the basis of lowest price.&#xD;

Interoperability saliency: The European Legal Interoperability Agreement ABB is salient for the governance of interoperability because it lays the European framework between public administration to enable the interoperability between public services. The European Legal Interoperability Agreement ABB is also salient for the legal interoperability due to the legal foundations and requirements that enable the seamless exchange of data, information, and knowledge between European and EEA Member State digital public services. The European Legal Interoperability Agreement ABB is also salient for the organizational interoperability since, as a consequence of the agreement, digital business capabilities can be mapped and subsequently, the process can be aligned between the Member State and EEA Public Administrations and digital public services.

It is available in all EU languages and used as a preliminary evidence of fulfilment of the conditions required in public procurement procedures across the EU. Thanks to the ESPD, the tenderers no longer have to provide full documentary evidence and different forms previously used in the EU procurement, which means a significant simplification of access to cross-border tendering opportunities.

Consul&#xD;
Consul has multiple components, but as a whole, it is a tool for discovering and configuring services in an infrastructure. It provides several key features:&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Service Discovery: Clients of Consul can provide a service, such as api or mysql, and other clients can use Consul to discover providers of a given service. Using either DNS or HTTP, applications can easily find the services they depend upon.&#xD;
•	Health Checking: Consul clients can provide any number of health checks, either associated with a given service (&quot;is the webserver returning 200 OK&quot;), or with the local node (&quot;is memory utilization below 90%&quot;). This information can be used by an operator to monitor cluster health, and it is used by the service discovery components to route traffic away from unhealthy hosts.&#xD;
•	KV Store: Applications can make use of Consul's hierarchical key/value store for any number of purposes, including dynamic configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election, and more. The simple HTTP API makes it easy to use.&#xD;
•	Multi Datacenter: Consul supports multiple datacenters out of the box. This means users of Consul do not have to worry about building additional layers of abstraction to grow to multiple regions.&#xD;

OpenNebula&#xD;
The OpenNebula monitoring subsystem gathers information relative to the hosts and the virtual machines, such as the host status, basic performance indicators, as well as VM status and capacity consumption. This information is collected by executing a set of static probes provided by OpenNebula. The information is sent according to the following process: each host periodically sends monitoring data to the front-end which collects it and processes it in a dedicated module. This model is highly scalable and its limit (in terms of number of VMs monitored per second) is bounded to the performance of the server running on and the database server.&#xD;
OpenNebula also brings resource quota management to allocate, track and limit resource utilization/consumption.&#xD;

Log4j 2&#xD;
Apache Log4j is a Java-based logging utility, part of the Apache Logging Services project of the Apache Software Foundation. &#xD;
Log4j 1.x has been widely adopted and used in many applications. However, through the years development on it has slowed down. It has become more difficult to maintain due to its need to be compliant with very old versions of Java and became End of Life in August 2015. &#xD;
Improvements in Log4j 2:&#xD;
•	Log4j 2 is designed to be usable as an audit logging framework. &#xD;
•	Log4j 2 contains next-generation Asynchronous Loggers based on the LMAX Disruptor library. In multi-threaded scenarios Asynchronous Loggers have 10 times higher throughput and orders of magnitude lower latency than Log4j 1.x and Logback.&#xD;
•	Log4j 2 is garbage free for stand-alone applications, and low garbage for web applications during steady state logging. This reduces pressure on the garbage collector and can give better response time performance.&#xD;
•	Log4j 2 uses a Plugin system that makes it extremely easy to extend the framework by adding new Appenders, Filters, Layouts, Lookups, and Pattern Converters without requiring any changes to Log4j.&#xD;
•	Support for custom log levels. Custom log levels can be defined in code or in configuration.&#xD;
•	Support for Message objects. Messages allow support for interesting and complex constructs to be passed through the logging system and be efficiently manipulated. &#xD;
•	Log4j 2 takes advantage of Java 5 concurrency support and performs locking at the lowest level possible. &#xD;
•	It is an Apache Software Foundation project following the community and support model used by all ASF projects. &#xD;

ZooKeeper is a centralized service registry for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the applications are deployed.&#xD;

OpenNebula&#xD;
The OpenNebula monitoring subsystem gathers information relative to the hosts and the virtual machines, such as the host status, basic performance indicators, as well as VM status and capacity consumption. This information is collected by executing a set of static probes provided by OpenNebula. The information is sent according to the following process: each host periodically sends monitoring data to the front-end which collects it and processes it in a dedicated module. This model is highly scalable and its limit (in terms of number of VMs monitored per second) is bounded to the performance of the server running on and the database server.&#xD;
OpenNebula also brings resource quota management to allocate, track and limit resource utilization/consumption.&#xD;

Graylog2 - open source log management platform&#xD;
Graylog2 is an open source log management platform. Each message is saved in an Elasticsearch database and a web interface allows to manage and analyse the logs.&#xD;
Graylog2 is divided into two parts: graylog2-server and graylog2-web-interface. The first is a Java application that accepts messages on different protocols: UDP, TCP, GELF, AMQP... Each message is analysed and saved in the Elasticsearch database. A Rest API is also integrated into the tool and is used in particular by the web-interface part. This allows to manage users, streams and dashboards. &#xD;
Some possible uses: &#xD;
•	Centralization of the logs: several types of inputs: syslog, GELF, raw... Rather than having to connect to each of the servers to consult the error logs, they can be configured to send all the messages in Graylog2.&#xD;
•	Debug application&#xD;
•	Exception handling&#xD;
•	Log analysis&#xD;
For example, it can easily list the clients who are still using the deprecated version of an API. Another search can e.g. allow you to list the largest consumers or the most used parts of an API.&#xD;
Graylog Enterprise is built on top of the Graylog open source platform and offers additional features: &#xD;
•	Archiving: automatically archive the data that are not searched through very often. Store this data on more cost-effective, slower hard disks and make it available for search in Graylog only when needed.&#xD;
•	Audit Log: Graylog Enterprise also offers Audit Log capabilities. Audit Log records and stores actions taken by a user or administrator that make changes in the Graylog system.&#xD;

INTEROPERABILITY SALIENCY:&#xD;
IoP Dimension: Behavioral IoP&#xD;
The Data Warehouse Service ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides and shares the functionality for the short-term or medium-term preservation of records and information in electronic form in order to ensure their temporal egibility, reliability and integrity and to ease their management as stated in the EIF: &quot;Legislation requires that decisions and data are stored and can be accessed for a specified time. This means that records and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions.&quot;&#xD;

It is therefore a central database in which are recorded:&#xD;
•	all Belgians residing in Belgium;&#xD;
•	all Belgians residing abroad who register in the population registers held in Belgian diplomatic missions or consular posts abroad;&#xD;
•	all foreigners residing in Belgium who are admitted or authorized to settle or reside in the Kingdom;&#xD;
•	all foreigners (and their family members) who declare themselves refugees or who are seeking recognition of refugee status.&#xD;
&#xD;
The municipalities (and the Immigration Office for the last category of the population) are responsible for recording the information. As a pillar of e-government, the National Register ensures the sharing of authentic data identifying individuals between different public services with limited access to such data. The Sectorial Committee of the National Register established within the Commission for the Protection of Privacy is competent to authorize access to the information of the National Register or the communication thereof.&#xD;

      <documentation>Definition: Shared platform ABB is a Application Component setting technical (re)usable resources with convergence power, in relation to public policy goals attainment, enabling interoperability from a technical perspective cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. 

Source: Gartner

Additional information: This convergence power is based on the instrumental nature and efficiencies  of these resources for enabling common problem-solving approaches. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared platform (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the technical perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared platform (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the technical perspective). The level of technical interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared platform enables: i) structural interoperability with technical resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. service registry service); ii) behavioural interoperability with technical resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. Technical interfaces); and iii) governance interoperability with technical resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge(i.e. Technical Interoperability Agreements).

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The Commission proposed a framework for a European Digital Identity which will be available to all EU citizens, residents, and businesses in the EU. Citizens will be able to prove their identity and share electronic documents from their European Digital Identity wallets with the click of a button on their phone. They will be able to access online services with their national digital identification, which will be recognised throughout Europe. Very large platforms will be required to accept the use of European Digital Identity wallets upon request of the user, for example to prove their age.(https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2663)

IoP Dimension: Structural  IoP  Behavioral IoP, Governance IoP

LOST view: Technical view - application

Interoperability saliency: The Shared Platform ABB is a key interoperability enabler because it supports to achieve technical interoperability with public policy goals convergence value by  all in all enabling i) the provision/consumption of  back-office digital public services,  ii) the exchange of data, information, and knowledge between digital public services and individuals , and iii) collaboration between digital public services.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): eDelivery - Supporting secure and reliable exchange of data and documents - eDelivery is a network of nodes for digital communications. It is based on a distributed model where every participant becomes a node using standard transport protocols and security policies. eDelivery helps public administrations to exchange electronic data and documents with other public administrations, businesses and citizens, in an interoperable, secure, reliable and trusted way. eDelivery is one of the building blocks of the European Commission's Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). These building blocks are reusable specifications, software and services that will form part of a wide variety of IT systems in different policy domains of the EU. The CEF eDelivery building block is based on the AS4 messaging protocol, open and free for all, developed by the OASIS standards development organisation. To ease its adoption in Europe, eDelivery uses the AS4 implementation guidelines defined by the Member States in the e-SENS Large Scale Pilot. Organisations must install an Access Point, or use a Service Provider, to exchange information with the AS4 messaging protocol.(https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eDelivery)

Synonym: Preservation Service

Additional information: The EIRA© differentiates between document management, record management and e-archiving as follows: •	Document management is primarily about day-to-day use of electronic documents (create/update/delete/versioning) within the operational environment; •	Record management is primarily about ensuring that information (e.g. in form of an electronic document or database record) is available for business and legal purposes (e.g. to proof and track the handling of contracts). If an electronic document or information is becoming a record (an authority declares it as a record) that electronic document or information needs to be handled by the record management service (based on specific business or legal reasons (e.g. contract negotiation)); •	e-Archiving is primarily about storing records which have been selected (by an authority) for permanent or long-term preservation due to their enduring research value and as a memory aid. An electronic document or information which a) is managed by the document management service or the record management service and b) is no longer needed for business or legal purposes or day-to-day activities, and c) still has value for research purposes or as a memory aid, the electronic document should be managed by the e-archiving service”.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): CEF eArchiving - eArchiving provides the core specifications, software, training and knowledge to tackle the challenge of short, medium and long-term data management and reuse in a sustainable, authentic, cost-efficient, manageable and interoperable way.(https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eArchiving)

IoP Dimension: Structural IoP

Interoperability saliency: The e-Archiving Component ABB  is salient for technical interoperability because it provides the implementation of the functionalities for the long-term or permanent preservation of records and information in electronic form in order to ensure their temporal egibility, reliability and integrity as stated in the EIF: &quot;Legislation requires that decisions and data are stored and can be accessed for a specified time. This means that records and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions.&quot;

Additional information: The logistics of interoperability testing is usually more costly (time, coordination, interoperability), and interoperability testing is no substitute for a conformance test suite. Experience shows that interoperability testing is more successful and less costly when conformance of implementations has been tested first.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Interoperability Testbed - The Test Bed allows users to execute predefined test cases on their systems in order to test the conformance to standards and requirements, simulate a web-service, validate content and test a complete message exchange protocol. The Testbed manages test cases and users, and orchestrates domain-specific components, the domain-specific logic is in separate components that are used via web services. Test results are provided in a standardised, machine-readable format. The Test Bed also offers a test registry and repository (TRR) to store test artefacts (assertions, test cases, validation schemas, etc.) and compile test services (validation services, simulator services, etc.).

Synonym: Preservation Service

Additional information: The EIRA(c) differentiates between document management, record management and e-archiving as follows: - Document management is primarily about day-to-day use of electronic documents (create/update/delete/versioning) within the operational environment; - Record management is primarily about ensuring that information (e.g. in form of an electronic document or database record) is available for business and legal purposes (e.g. to proof and track the handling of contracts). If an electronic document or information is becoming a record (an authority declares it as a record) that electronic document or information needs to be handled by the record management service (based on specific business or legal reasons (e.g. contract negotiation)); - e-Archiving is primarily about storing records which have been selected (by an authority) for permanent or long-term preservation due to their enduring research value and as a memory aid. An electronic document or information which a) is managed by the document management service or the record management service and b) is no longer needed for business or legal purposes or day-to-day activities, and c) still has value for research purposes or as a memory aid, the electronic document should be managed by the e-archiving service”.

Additional information:  An ‘electronic signature’ means data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign. ‘Validation’ means the process of verifying and confirming that an electronic signature or a seal is valid.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): CEF eSignature DSS - DSS (Digital Signature Services) is an open-source software library for electronic signature creation and validation. DSS supports the creation and verification of interoperable and secure electronic signatures in line with European legislation. In particular, DSS aims to follow the eIDAS Regulation and related standards closely. DSS can be re-used in an IT solution for electronic signatures to ensure that signatures are created and verified in line with European legislation and standards. DSS allows re-use in a variety of different ways: in an applet, in a stand-alone application or in a server application. DSS can also be used as a reference implementation for IT solutions which do not directly re-use it. CEF eSignature's DSS open-source library delivers the following benefits to its users: •	Open-source software under LGPL 2.1, a non-viral open source license; •	Interoperability of the e-signatures; •	Supports both e-signatures and e-seals; •	Validation of countersignatures and multiple signatures; •	Alignment with the eIDAS Regulation and related standards; •	Supports EU standards on: o	Signature formats and packaging methods;  o	Signature validation procedures; •	Validation relying on Member States' trusted lists: o	Status of trust service providers/trust service, compensation of information, path validation. https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eSignaturefile:///C:/Users/bocquilp/Downloads/DSS(ServiceOfferingDescription)%20(v0.03)%20(5).pdf

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): European Data Portal - The European Data Portal harvests the metadata of Public Sector Information available on public data portals across European countries. Information regarding the provision of data and the benefits of re-using data is also included. What is Open Data? -	Open (Government) Data refers to the information collected, produced or paid for by the public bodies (also referred to as Public Sector Information) and made freely available for re-use for any purpose. The licence will specify the terms of use; -	Public sector information is information held by the public sector. The Directive on the re-use of public sector information provides a common legal framework for a European market for government-held data. It is built around the key pillars of the internal market: free flow of data, transparency and fair competition. It is important to note that not all of the public sector information is Open Data. Within the Portal, sections are dedicated to: -	Searching datasets: Categories have been established to structure the metadata harvested from the various countries. These categories follow the revision of the DCAT Application Profile and have been mapped against the Eurovoc Thesaurus; -	Providing Data: This section gives an insight into understanding Open Data from the perspective of a data provider. In addition, instructions are offered for those who wish their data portal to be harvested by the European Data Portal; -	Using Data: How Open Data is being used, as well as the economic benefits of Open Data are detailed in this section; -	Training and Library: eLearning modules about Open Data as well as training guides and a knowledge base referencing publications around Open Data and featured projects; - Portals can be national, regional, local or domain specific. They cover the 28 EU Member States, EEA, countries involved in the EU's neighbourhood policy and Switzerland. https://www.europeandataportal.eu/

Additional information: Specifically, Blockchain  stores records that contain a time stamp and reference links to previous transactions. With this information, anyone with access rights can trace back a transactional event, at any point in its history, belonging to any participant. A blockchain is one architectural design of the broader concept of distributed ledgers.

Interoperability saliency: The Blockchain Application Service ABB is salient for interoperability because as a ledger technology application service can contribute to the trustability of digital public services. It can enable the register and list of irrevocable transactional data being exchanged between digital public services. To that extent, a blockchain service can be enhancing digital public services by establishing a mechanism to track data, and the process applied to it.

Source: eIDAS - REGULATION (EU) No 910/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC. 

Source reference: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG

Additional information: An ‘electronic signature’ means data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): CEF eSignature DSS - DSS (Digital Signature Services) is an open-source software library for electronic signature creation and validation. DSS supports the creation and verification of interoperable and secure electronic signatures in line with European legislation. In particular, DSS aims to follow the eIDAS Regulation and related standards closely. DSS can be re-used in an IT solution for electronic signatures to ensure that signatures are created and verified in line with European legislation and standards. DSS allows re-use in a variety of different ways: in an applet, in a stand-alone application or in a server application. DSS can also be used as a reference implementation for IT solutions which do not directly re-use it. CEF eSignature's DSS open-source library delivers the following benefits to its users: •	Open-source software under LGPL 2.1, a non-viral open source license; •	Interoperability of the e-signatures; •	Supports both e-signatures and e-seals; •	Validation of countersignatures and multiple signatures; •	Alignment with the eIDAS Regulation and related standards; •	Supports EU standards on: o	Signature formats and packaging methods;  o	Signature validation procedures; •	Validation relying on Member States' trusted lists: o	Status of trust service providers/trust service, compensation of information, path validation. https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eSignaturefile:///C:/Users/bocquilp/Downloads/DSS(ServiceOfferingDescription)%20(v0.03)%20(5).pdf

In particular, DSS aims to follow the eIDAS Regulation and related standards closely. DSS can be re-used in an IT solution for electronic signatures to ensure that signatures are created and verified in line with European legislation and standards. DSS allows re-use in a variety of different ways: in an applet, in a stand-alone application or in a server application. DSS can also be used as a reference implementation for IT solutions which do not directly re-use it. CEF eSignature's DSS open-source library delivers the following benefits to its users: •&#x9;Open-source software under LGPL 2.1, a non-viral open source license; •&#x9;Interoperability of the e-signatures; •&#x9;Supports both e-signatures and e-seals; •&#x9;Validation of countersignatures and multiple signatures; •&#x9;Alignment with the eIDAS Regulation and related standards; •&#x9;Supports EU standards on: o&#x9;Signature formats and packaging methods;  o&#x9;Signature validation procedures; •&#x9;Validation relying on Member States' trusted lists: o&#x9;Status of trust service providers/trust service, compensation of information, path validation. https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eSignaturefile:///C:/Users/bocquilp/Downloads/DSS(ServiceOfferingDescription)%20(v0.03)%20(5).pdf"/>

All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage.

Additional information: Data mapping is used for a wide variety of tasks, including: - Data mediation between a data source and a destination; - Data transformation; - Identification of data relationships as part of data lineage analysis; - Discovery of hidden sensitive data such as the last four digits of a social security number hidden in another user id as part of a data masking or de-identification project; - Consolidation of multiple databases into a single database and identifying redundant columns of data for consolidation or elimination.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Microsoft Dynamics CRM Mapping Schema - Microsoft Dynamics CRM contains several data sets which comprise of different objects, such as Leads, Opportunities, and Competitors. Each of these data sets has several fields like Name, Account Owner, City, Country, Job Title, and more. The application has a defined schema along with attributes, enumerations, and mapping rules. Therefore, if a new record is to be added to the schema of a data object, a data map needs to be created from the data source to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM account.

      <documentation>Definition: Ontology ABB is a Data Object that defines a set of representational primitives with which to model a domain of knowledge or discourse

Source: Formal definiion of Tom Gruber

Source reference: https://tomgruber.org/writing/definition-of-ontology

Additional information: Ontology ABB is a Data Object aiming to be a formal description of knowledge, as a set of concepts, within a domain and the axioms connecting concepts and allowing for logic inferences. When speaking about an ontology, we do not refer only to the terminology (or T-Box) but also to all the “assertions” about the concepts and roles (the A-Box), i.e. all the individuals or instances of concepts and roles of the terminology and as important, the rules for logic inference: the semantics “part&quot;.

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology (MedDRA) - The university ontology includes classes, e.g., :Staff, :Students, :Department or :Course. These classes denote natural concepts that are shared or at least understood by users familiar with universities all over the world. Universities ontologies can be view in university portals.(http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/MEDDRA)

IoP Dimension: Governance IoP

LOST view: Semantic view

Interoperability saliency: The Ontology ABB is salient for semantic interoperability because it defined as a simplified, reusable and extensible data model that capture the fundamental characteristics of a data entity in a context-neutral and syntax-neutral fashion.

        <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Technological neutrality and data portability ABB is a Principle establishing European public services. Public administrations should focus on functional needs and defer decisions on technology as long as possible in order to minimise technological dependencies, to avoid imposing specific technical implementations or products on their constituents and to be able to adapt to the rapidly evolving technological environment.

Public administrations should provide for access and reuse of their public services and data irrespective of specific technologies or products.

The functioning of the digital single market requires data to be easily transferable among different systems to avoid lock-in, support the free movement of data. This requirement relates to data portability - the ability to move and reuse data easily among different applications and systems, which becomes even more challenging in cross-border scenarios.

        <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Multilingualism ABB is a Principle considering that European public services can potentially be used by anyone in any Member State. Citizens across Europe often have problems in accessing and using digital public services if these are not available in the languages they speak.

A balance needs to be found between the expectations of citizens and businesses to be served in their own language(s) or their preferred language(s) and the ability of Member States’ public administrations to offer services in all official EU languages. 
A suitable balance could be that European public services are available in the languages of the expected end-users, i.e. the number of languages is decided on the basis of users’ needs, such as the level to which the service is critical for the implementation of the digital single market or national policies, or the size of the relevant audience.

Multilingualism comes into play not just in the user interface, but at all levels in the design of European public services. For example, the choices made on data representation in an electronic database should not limit its ability to support different languages.

The multilingual aspect of interoperability becomes also relevant when a public service requires exchanges between information systems across language boundaries, as the meaning of the information exchanged must be preserved.

Inclusion and accessibility ABB is a Principle enabling everyone to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by new technologies to access and make use of European public services, overcoming social and economic divides and exclusion.
Accessibility ensures that people with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups can use public services at service levels comparable to those provided to other citizens.

Inclusion and accessibility must be part of the whole development lifecycle of a European public service in terms of design, information content and delivery. It should comply with e-accessibility specifications widely recognised at European or international level.

Inclusion and accessibility usually involve multi-channel delivery. Traditional paper-based or face-to-face service delivery may need to co-exist with electronic delivery.

Inclusion and accessibility can also be improved by an information system’s ability to allow third parties to act on behalf of citizens who are unable, either permanently or temporarily, to make direct use of public services.

        <documentation>DEFINITION: &#xD;
Openness ABB is a Principle relating to data, specifications and software, in the context of interoperable public services.

Open government data (here simply referred ‘open data’) refers to the idea that all public data should be freely available for use and reuse by others, unless restrictions apply e.g. for protection of personal data, confidentiality, or intellectual property rights. Public administrations collect and generate huge amounts of data. The Directive on the reuse of public sector information (PSI)7 encourages Member States to make public information available for access and reuse as open data. The INSPIRE Directive8 requires, in addition, sharing of spatial datasets and services between public authorities with no restrictions or practical obstacles to its reuse. This data should be published with as few restrictions as possible and clear licences for its use to allow better scrutiny of administrations’ decision-making processes and realise transparency in practice.

The use of open source software technologies and products can help save development cost, avoid a lock-in effect and allow fast adaptation to specific business needs because the developer communities that support them are constantly adapting them. Public administrations should not only use open source software but whenever possible contribute to the pertinent developer communities. Open source is an enabler of the underlying EIF principle on reusability.

The level of openness of a specification/standard is decisive for the reuse of software components implementing that specification. This also applies when such components are used to introduce new European public services. If the openness principle applies in full:
* all stakeholders have the opportunity to contribute to the development of the specification and a public review is part of the decision-making process;
* the specification is available for everyone to study;
* intellectual property rights to the specification are licensed on FRAND9 terms, in a way that allows implementation in both proprietary and open source software10, and preferably on a royalty-free basis.

Due to their positive effect on interoperability, the use of open specifications has been promoted in many policy statements and is encouraged for European public service delivery. The positive effect of open specifications is demonstrated by the internet ecosystem. However, public administrations may decide to use less open specifications if open ones do not exist or do not meet functional needs. In all cases, specifications should be mature and sufficiently supported by the market, unless they are being used to create innovative solutions.

Lastly, openness also means empowering citizens and businesses to get involved in the design of new services, to contribute to service improvement and to give feedback about the quality of the existing public services.

        <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Preservation of information ABB is a Principle requiring that decisions and data are stored and can be accessed for a specified time. This means that records18 and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions.

To guarantee the long-term preservation of electronic records and other kinds of information, formats should be chosen to ensure long-term accessibility, including preservation of associated electronic signatures or seals. In this regard, the use of qualified preservation services, in line with Regulation (EU) 910/2014, can ensure the long-term preservation of information.

For information sources owned and managed by national administrations, preservation is a purely national matter. For information that is not strictly national, preservation becomes a European issue. In that case, an appropriate ‘preservation policy’ should be applied by the Member States concerned, to cope with any difficulties arising if the relevant information is used under different jurisdictions.

        <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Reusability ABB is a principle meaning that, public administrations confronted with a specific problem seek to benefit from the work of others by looking at what is available, assessing its usefulness or relevance to the problem at hand, and where appropriate, adopting solutions that have proven their value elsewhere. This requires the public administration to be open to sharing its interoperability solutions, concepts, frameworks, specifications, tools and components with others.

Reusability of IT solutions (e.g. software components, Application Programming Interfaces, standards), information and data, is an enabler of interoperability and improves quality because it extends operational use, as well as saving money and time. This makes it a major contributor to the development of a digital single market in the EU. Some EU standards and specifications also exist in the DIFs and should be applied more widely. For example, the INSPIRE Directive sets out interoperability standards for addresses, cadastres, roads and many other data topics of relevance to many public administrations. These existing standards and specifications can and should be used more widely beyond the domain for which they were originally developed.

Several public administrations and governments across the EU already promote sharing and reuse of IT solutions by adopting new business models, promoting the use of open source software for key ICT services and when deploying digital service infrastructure.

There are some key challenges that limit the sharing and reuse of IT solutions, at technical, organisational, legal and communication levels. The ISA² sharing and reuse framework for IT solutions12 provides recommendations for public administrations to help them overcome these challenges and share/reuse common IT solutions. Reuse and sharing can be effectively supported by collaborative platforms.

New Public Management approach ABB is a Principle arosing out of a concern with government failures, a belief in the efficacy and efficiency  of markets, a belief in economic rationality, and a push away from  large, centralized government agencies toward devolution and privatization.&#xD;
In New Public Management, public managers are urged to &quot;&quot;steer,  not row.&quot;&quot; They steer by determining objectives, or what should be  done, and by catalyzing service delivery, or how it should be done (rowing), via their choice of a particular &quot;&quot;tool&quot;&quot; or combination of  tools (e.g., markets, regulation, taxes, subsidies, insurance, etc.) for achieving the objectives (Salamon 200)&#xD;

        <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Transparency ABB is a Principle refering to:
1. Enabling visibility inside the administrative environment of a public administration. This is about allowing other public administrations, citizens and businesses to view and understand administrative rules, processes11, data, services and decision-making.
2. Ensuring availability of interfaces with internal information systems. Public administrations operate a large number of what are often heterogeneous and disparate information systems in support of their internal processes. Interoperability depends on ensuring the availability of interfaces to these systems and the data they handle. In turn, interoperability facilitates reuse of systems and data, and enables these to be integrated into larger systems.
3. Securing the right to the protection of personal data, by respecting the applicable legal framework for the large volumes of personal data of citizens, held and managed by Public administrations.

Administrative simplification ABB is a Principle improving and simplyfing administration processes when they do not provide public value. Administrative simplification can help businesses and citizens to reduce the administrative burden of complying with EU legislation or national obligations. Likewise, public administrations should introduce European public services supported by electronic means, including their interactions with other public administrations, citizens and businesses.

Digitisation of public services should take place in accordance with the following concepts:
* digital-by-default, whenever appropriate, so that there is at least one digital channel available for accessing and using a given European public service;
* digital-first which means that priority is given to using public services via digital channels while applying the multi-channel delivery concept and the no-wrong-door policy, i.e. physical and digital channels co-exist.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Transparency: EIF Transparency Principle refers to: 1. Enabling visibility inside the administrative environment of a public administration. This is about allowing other public administrations, citizens and businesses to view and understand administrative rules, processes, data, services and decision-making.  2. Ensuring availability of interfaces with internal information systems. Public administrations operate a large number of what are often heterogeneous and disparate information systems in support of their internal processes. Interoperability depends on ensuring the availability of interfaces to these systems and the data they handle. In turn, interoperability facilitates reuse of systems and data, and enables these to be integrated into larger systems. 3. Securing the right to the protection of personal data, by respecting the applicable legal framework for the large volumes of personal data of citizens, held and managed by Public administrations.(https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf)

      <documentation>Definition: Public Policy Context ABB is a Constraint that describes the background against which policy decisions are made, policy processes take place and stakeholders or actors engage with the policy.

Source reference: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0009.12026

Additional information: Public Policy Context is a specialisation of Public Policy Constraint. As such, Public Policy Context(s) provides the limits for the realisation of goals. In contrast to requirements, a Public Policy Constraint does not prescribe some intended functionality of the system to be realized but might impose restrictions on the implementation of the system (e.g., specific technology that is to be used, such as the usage of open source software), a restriction on the implementation process (e.g., time or budget constraints), or a restriction on the functioning of the system (e.g., legal constraints).

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The European Cybersecurity Strategy has won a relevant role in the European IT environment since Ukraine's was started. Cybersecurity attacks have become a regular war method. Therefore, the context for the strength and increasing efforts by the Commission is this singular event. The following link illustrates the state of the art: Russia's war on Ukraine: Timeline of cyber-attacks. https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2022)733549

      <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Achieve Semantic Interoperability ABB is a Goal. For the purpose of the EIF, interoperability is the ability of organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between these organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data between their ICT systems.
The interoperability model which is applicable to all digital public services and may also be considered as an integral element of the interoperability-by-design paradigm. It includes: four layers of interoperability: legal, organisational, semantic and technical.

Semantic interoperability ensures that the precise format and meaning of exchanged data and information is preserved and understood throughout exchanges between parties, in other words ‘what is sent is what is understood’. In the EIF, semantic interoperability covers both semantic and syntactic aspects.

Additional information: Do not confuse Digital Agenda with Digitalisation Roadmap. An Agenda focuses on goals and priorities, e.g. protecting citizens and freedoms, developing a strong and vibrant economic base, building a climate-neutral, green, fair and social Europe, promoting European interests and values on the global stage, etc. A Roadmap focuses on the actions and deadlines that need to be executed to realise the Agenda.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The Digital Agenda for Europe. See https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/64/digital-agenda-for-europe. The widespread, rapid and extensive development of digital service platforms, as well as debates on public data spaces and new technologies such as artificial intelligence, affect all areas of our society. Many new ways to communicate, shop or access information online have been integrated into our daily lives and are constantly evolving. The European digital agenda for the decade 2020-2030 addresses these issues by focusing on creating secure digital spaces and services, creating a level playing field in digital markets with large platforms and strengthening Europe’s digital sovereignty, while contributing to the European goal of climate neutrality by 2050.

      <documentation>DEFINITION:&#xD;
Achieve Organisational Interoperability ABB is Goal. For the purpose of the EIF, interoperability is the ability of organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between these organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data between their ICT systems.
The interoperability model which is applicable to all digital public services and may also be considered as an integral element of the interoperability-by-design paradigm. It includes: four layers of interoperability: legal, organisational, semantic and technical.

Organisational interoperability refers to the way in which public administrations align their business processes, responsibilities and expectations to achieve commonly agreed and mutually beneficial goals. In practice, organisational interoperability means documenting and integrating or aligning business processes and relevant information exchanged. Organisational interoperability also aims to meet the requirements of the user community by making services available, easily identifiable, accessible and user-focused.

eDelivery&#xD;
Supporting secure and reliable exchange of data and documents&#xD;
eDelivery is a network of nodes for digital communications. It is based on a distributed model where every participant becomes a node using standard transport protocols and security policies. eDelivery helps public administrations to exchange electronic data and documents with other public administrations, businesses and citizens, in an interoperable, secure, reliable and trusted way. eDelivery is one of the building blocks of the European Commission's Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). These building blocks are reusable specifications, software and services that will form part of a wide variety of IT systems in different policy domains of the EU. The CEF eDelivery building block is based on the AS4 messaging protocol, open and free for all, developed by the OASIS standards development organisation. To ease its adoption in Europe, eDelivery uses the AS4 implementation guidelines defined by the Member States in the e-SENS Large Scale Pilot. Organisations must install an Access Point, or use a Service Provider, to exchange information with the AS4 messaging protocol.&#xD;

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Transparency: EIF Transparency Principle refers to: 1. Enabling visibility inside the administrative environment of a public administration. This is about allowing other public administrations, citizens and businesses to view and understand administrative rules, processes, data, services and decision-making.  2. Ensuring availability of interfaces with internal information systems. Public administrations operate a large number of what are often heterogeneous and disparate information systems in support of their internal processes. Interoperability depends on ensuring the availability of interfaces to these systems and the data they handle. In turn, interoperability facilitates reuse of systems and data, and enables these to be integrated into larger systems. 3. Securing the right to the protection of personal data, by respecting the applicable legal framework for the large volumes of personal data of citizens, held and managed by Public administrations.(https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf)

Additional information: The European Library of Architecture Principles (ELAP) ABB is a principle intended to direct government organizations in initiating changes and implementing IT projects. Particularly when designing new or modified services, it is necessary to make visible how the principles are implemented and which considerations are made in this regard. The apply-or-explain principle applies here, whereby deviations are permitted provided that they are substantiated and recorded with good arguments so that they can be revisited at a later stage. This prevents important matters from being overlooked.

Interoperability saliency: The European Library of Architecture Principles ABB is salient for governance interoperability due to it establishes the principles and framework to ensure interoperability at the European level. Also, the European Library of Architecture Principles ABB is salient for organizational interoperability due to it establishes requirements and business processes to enable interoperability between public services.

Additional information: The granularity of the requirements might be of high level or detail level. Requirements of high-level granularity contain generic/abstract functional requirements like principles and/or recommendations with considerable degrees for transposition/execution and of not binding nature. On the other side, requirements of detail-level granularity imply a limited degree for transposition/execution and they contain specific/concrete functionalities, solution components, data, procedures, and/or technical specifications or standards to be used.

Additional information: The provision of digital public services are Public Administration's means of implementing e-Government. Certain countries make the difference between e-Government (policy implementation management) and e-Administration (administrative procedure management using electronic means). For these countries, the case of the SDG would fall under the e-Administration umbrella.

Example: The following implementation is an example of how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The European Commission; the central, regional or local executive arm of a MS.

IoP Dimension: Behavioural IoP

LOST view: Organisational view

Interoperability saliency: The Public Administration ABB is salient for behavioural and organizational interoperability because it represents the specific authority in charge of supporting the definition of procedures and business rules to publish digital business capabilities. It also allows the security assurance and control configuration associated with this authority or public entity, the discovery of data types that it can provide, as well as other aspects necessary to assure, monitor and control the exchange of data between this public entity and the digital public services providing to or consuming data from this stakeholder.

Additional information: This convergence power is based on the enabling sense-making nature of these resources influencing the enactment of common understanding from the existing organisational information. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared knowledge base (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the semantic perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared knowledge base (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the semantic perspective).

Additional information: This convergence power is based on the enabling communication and harmonization nature of these resources influencing collaboration cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared governance framework (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the organisational perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared governance framework (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the organizational perspective). The level of organizational interoperability will constrain digital public services cross levels in a public administration, cross public administrations, and cross borders. The shared governance framework enables: i) structural interoperability with organisational resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. public services catalogues); ii) behavioural interoperability with organisational resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. user experience patterns and service delivery mode); and iii) governance interoperability with governance resources supporting the assurance and control of collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information, and knowledge (i.e. Organisational Interoperability Agreements).

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): The recent economic and financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the EU's economic governance. The EU responded by taking a wide range of measures to strengthen its governance and to facilitate a return to sustainable economic growth, job creation, financial stability and sound public finances.(https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/eu-economic-governance-explained.pdf)

Additional information: The degree of achievement could range from an ideal perfect shared legal framework (i.e. no interoperability barriers from the legal perspective) to an imperfect or even null shared legal framework (i.e. some interoperability barriers from the legal perspective). The level of legal interoperability will constrain digital public services cross-legal jurisdictions.

        <documentation>The Interoperability Security and Privacy viewpoint models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks related to both security and privacy in the domain of interoperability. Citizens and businesses must be confident that when they interact with public authorities they are doing so in a secure and trustworthy environment and in full compliance with relevant regulations, e.g. the Regulation and Directive on data protection, and the Regulation on electronic identification and trust services. Public administrations must guarantee the citizens’ privacy, and the confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of information provided by citizens and businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
Security and privacy are primary concerns in the provision of public services. When public administrations and other entities exchange official information, the information should be transferred, depending on security requirements, via a secure, harmonised, managed and controlled network. Transfer mechanisms should facilitate information exchanges between administrations, businesses and citizens. Appropriate mechanisms should allow secure exchange of electronically verified messages, records, forms and other kinds of information between the different systems; should handle specific security requirements and electronic identification and trust services such as electronic signatures/seals creation and verification; and should monitor traffic to detect intrusions, changes of data and other type of attacks.&#xD;

Narrative: This viewpoint selects Architecture Building Blocks from the five different view highlighting the Security and Privacy aspects of the EIRA©: &#xD;
&#xD;
1.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the legal view shows the [Public Policy], which is that mainspring of the solution&#xD;
&#xD;
2.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the organisational view shows the [Security Framework], associated with the [Security Governance] which is that mainspring of the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
3.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the semantic view shows the [Security Policy], which is that mainspring of the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
4.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical view Application shows that a [Interoperable Digital Solution], which considers [Human Interface] and [Machine to Machine Interface] is supported by a [Shared platform] which uses [Trust Enablers], [Application Security Enablers], [Identification and Access Enablers] and [Data Exchange Enablers]. [Trust Enablers] such as [Integrity Verification Service], [e-Signature Creation Service], [e-Seal Creation Service], [e-Timestamp Creation Service], [e-Signature Verification and Validation Service], [e-Seal Verification and Validation Service], [e-Timestamp Verification and Validation Service], [e-Signature Preservation Service], [e-Seal Preservation Service] and [Registered Electronic Delivery Service], are all realised by a [Trust Service Provisioning Component]. [Identification and Access Enablers] is composed of [Authentication Service], [Request Validation Service] and [Registration Service] which are realised by [Identification Component] and that provides access to the [Directory], accessed also by the [Access Management Service], realised by the [Access Management Component]. [Application Security Enablers] is realised of [Firewall Service], composed of [Firewall Component] and [Audit Service], which is realised by an [Audit Component]. [Data Exchange Enablers] composed of Data Exchange Service] realised by the [Data Exchange Component].&#xD;
&#xD;
5. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical view Infrastructure shows an [Outsourcing Facility] and [On - Premise Facility] composed of [Back End Firewall] and [Extranet Firewall]. &#xD;
&#xD;
5.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the EIF Underlying Principles view show that [Interoperability Specifications] realises [EIF Principles], the general intended properties used to achieve interoperability, of which the [Security and Privacy] is a specialisation. The interoperability Specifications can be used to define the interoperability aspects for any of the Architecture Building Blocks&#xD;

        <documentation>The Interoperability Privacy viewpoint highlights the EIRA building blocks that are relevant when implementing the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or assessing an existing architecture against the GDPR principles. Public administrations must indeed guarantee the citizens’ privacy, and the confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of information provided by citizens and businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: The selected Architecture Building Blocks from the five different views highlight the Architecture Building Blocks of the EIRA that are that are relevant with respect to GDPR:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the legal view show that privacy requirements are coming from a [Public Policy] realised by a [Binding instrument].&#xD;
&#xD;
2. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the organisational view show that the [Privacy Framework] applies to the [Digital Public Service] which is assigned by the [Data Owner] and provided by the [Digital Public Service Provider]. The [Digital Public Service] serves the [Digital Public Service Delivery Consumer], assigned to an [Individual] that is associated to the [Information] accessible though the [Organisation] which is a specialissed by [Public Administration] and [Business].&#xD;
&#xD;
3. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the semantic view show that [Data] aggregates [Data Set], [Ontology] and [Data Mapping] and that it is subject to the [Data Policy].&#xD;
&#xD;
4. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the Technical View shows many service involving data impacted by the privacy regulation, such as&#xD;
[Data Extraction,Transformation and Loading Service], [Data Quality Service], [e-Archiving Service], [Data Publication Service], [Data Exchange Service] and [Data Management Service]; all the services reported are realised by their specific Application Component. Additionally, a [Privacy Service], realised by a [Privacy Component] implementing GDPR principle can be used to ensure compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
5.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the EIF Underlying Principles view show the [EIF Principle], the general intended properties used to achieve interoperability, of which the [Security and Privacy] is a specialisation. The interoperability Specifications can be used to define the interoperability aspects for any of the Architecture Building Blocks.</documentation>

        <documentation>The EIRA© Highlevel viewpoint models an introductory overview of the focal Architecture Building Blocks of each view.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ABBs included in the high-level viewpoint represent the points that link the EIRA©’s views enabling traceability between their different Architecture Building Blocks. They are not necessarily mandatory but should always be considered by a user of the EIRA© when executing one of its use cases.&#xD;

The EIRA© with its views provides a set of Architecture Building Blocks, important to facilitate interoperability. Each view, one for each interoperability level, is represented with the Focal Architecture Building Blocks needed to deliver an interoperable solution. These focal Architecture Building Blocks are indicated with an accented colour.&#xD;
In the high-level are represented the ABBs that link the EIRA©’s views enabling navigation between the different views. As such they should be considered as critical components of any interoperable public service. They are not necessarily mandatory but should always be considered by a user of the EIRA© when executing one of its use cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: This viewpoint selects Architecture Building Blocks from the five different views highlighting the focal building blocks of the EIRA©: &#xD;
&#xD;
1.	The selected Architecture Building Block of the legal view shows the [Public Policy] is realised by [Legal Act] and [Digital Public Service]; these two ABB, referred to the legal view, are aggregated within the [Shared Legal framework]. [Shared legal Framework] influences [Organisational Functional Content], [Semantic Functional Content], [Technical Application Functional Content].&#xD;
&#xD;
2.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the organizational view show a [Shared Governance Framework] that aggregates the [Organizational Functional Content] which considers a [Digital Public Service] which can be an aggregation of other [Digital Public Service]. The [Digital Public Service] realises a [Digital Business Capability]. A [Digital Business Capability] describes key functions supporting the [Digital Public Service]. A [Digital Public Service] accesses [Information], which can be an aggregation of other [Information]. At the same time a [Digital Public Service] is assigned by a [Digital Public Service Delivery] which is connected through a serving relation with the [Digital Public Service Delivery Model].&#xD;
&#xD;
3.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the semantic view shows the [Shared Knowledge Base] and that the [Semantic Functional Content] is composed of a [Representation], stored as [Data] and the [Ontology]. &#xD;
&#xD;
4.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical views - application shows that a [Interoperable Digital Solution Service] is composed of a [Digital Solution Service] realized by a [Digital Solution Component] and lets consumers access it via [Machine to Machine Interface] and/or [Human Interface], which are part of a [Application Presentation and Access Enablers]. A [Digital Solution] exposes one or more [Digital Solution Service] via its [Machine to Machine Interface] and/or [Human Interface]. The [Digital Solution] uses [Digital Service Infrastructure] which uses a [Computing Hosting, Networking, and Data Hosting Infrastructure]. &#xD;
&#xD;
5.	The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical views - infrastructure considers the [Computing Hosting, Networking and Data Hosting Infrastructure].</documentation>

        <documentation>The Key Interoperability Enablers viewpoint models the most salient key interoperability enablers(*). The viewpoint uses the ArchiMate© motivation extension to assess the structural interoperability readiness, the behavioral interoperability readiness and the governance interoperability readiness of solutions that are necessary to enable the efficient and effective delivery of public services across administrations. European public service provision often requires different public administrations to work together to meet end users’ needs and provide public services in an integrated way. When multiple organizations are involved there is a need for coordination and governance by the authorities with a mandate for planning, implementing and operating European public services. Services should be governed to ensure: collaboration, seamless execution, reuse of services and data, and development of new services and ‘building blocks'.&#xD;
 &#xD;
(*)DECISION (EU) 2015/2240 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25 November 2015 establishing a programme on interoperability solutions and common frameworks for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (ISA2 programme) as a means for modernising the public sector.&#xD;
 &#xD;
The Key Interoperability Enablers viewpoint covers all EIF interoperability aspects: legal, organisational, semantic and technical. Ensuring interoperability when preparing legal instruments, organisation business processes, data/information/knowledge exchange, services and components that support European interoperable digital public services is a continuous task, as interoperability is regularly disrupted by changes to the environment, i.e. in legislation, the needs of businesses or citizens, the organisational structure of public administrations, the business processes, and by the emergence of new technologies.&#xD;

Narrative: This viewpoint selects Architecture Building Blocks of the EIRA© that are key enablers for the interoperability of public services:&#xD;
&#xD;
1.	EIF [Interoperability Principles] are used to realise the overall goal of achieving interoperability. &#xD;
&#xD;
2.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieve Legal Interoperability] is realised by a [Shared Legal Framework] of [re]usable legal resources that enables:&#xD;
structural interoperability by legal resources supporting reusing and/or sharing legislation (i.e. [Legislation Catalogue] enabling provisioning/consuming legal texts cross public administrations and cross borders);&#xD;
behavioral interoperability by legal resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. [Legislation on Data Information and Knowledge Exchange] enabling data/information/knowledge to be provisioned/consumed cross public administrations and cross borders); and&#xD;
governance interoperability by legislation supporting the collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information or knowledge (i.e. [Legal Interoperability Agreement] on legal terms assuring juridical certainty enabling agreed legal terms/conditions for sharing, reuse and exchange of data/information/knowledge cross public administrations and cross borders). &#xD;
&#xD;
3.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Organisational Interoperability] is realised by a [Shared Governance Framework] of [re]usable organisational resources that enables: structural interoperability by organisational resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of digital public services (i.e. [Digital Public Service Catalogue] enabling provisioning/consuming public services cross public administrations and cross borders); behavioural interoperability by organisational resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. [Digital Public Service Delivery Model], served by [Digital Public Service Delivery] enabling data/information/knowledge to be provisioned/consumed cross public administrations and cross borders); and governance interoperability by governance resources supporting the collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information or knowledge (i.e. [Organisational Interoperability Agreement] on organisational terms/conditions enabling sharing, reuse and exchange of data/information/knowledge cross public administrations and cross borders).&#xD;
&#xD;
4.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Semantic Interoperability] is realized by a [Shared Knowledge Base] of usable data, information and knowledge resources that enables: structural interoperability by semantic resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of data, information and knowledge (i.e. [Data Set Catalogue], [Ontologies Catalogue] and [Data Mapping Catalogue] enabling provisioning/consuming data, information and knowledge cross public administrations and cross borders); behavioral interoperability by semantic resources supporting exchanging capabilities of data, information or knowledge with internal/external peers (i.e. [Open Data], [Distributed Ledger] and [Virtual Data Set]; and governance interoperability by semantic resources supporting the collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information or knowledge (i.e. [Semantic Interoperability Agreement] on interpretations enabling sharing, reuse and exchange of data/information/knowledge cross public administrations and cross borders).  &#xD;
&#xD;
5.	Particularly, the goal of [Achieving Technical Interoperability] is realised by a [Shared Application Content] and [Shared Infrastructure Content]. The [Shared Application Content] is a Grouping of ICT Resources components that enables structural interoperability by ICT resources supporting the reusing and sharing of data via [Software component Discovery and catalogue Service], [API Discovery and Catalogue Service] and [Service Discovery and Registry Service]; behavioural interoperability by ICT resources supporting communication via [Machine to Machine], [Human Interface], [Data Exchange Service], [UX Management Service] and [Digital Workplace Service], and governance interoperability by ICT resources supporting collaboration via [Technical Interoperability Agreements]. The [Shared Infrastructure Content] is a Grouping of ICT resources that enables structural interoperability by ICT resources supporting reusing and/or sharing of data via [Computing Hosting, Networking, and Data Hosting Infrastructure], behavioural interoperability by ICT resources supporting communication via [Technology Interface]. governance interoperability by ICT resources supports also the collaboration with internal/external peers exchanging data, information or knowledge (i.e. [Technical Interoperability Agreements] on technical terms/conditions enabling provisioning/consuming back-office services cross public administrations and cross borders), and governance interoperability by ICT resources supporting collaboration via [Technical Interoperability Agreements].</documentation>

[Analysis of a target digital public solution] groups the following ABBs: [Interoperability Dimension] which is associated with the [EIRA Architecture Building Blocks] requirement. the [EIRA Architecture Building Blocks] composes the [EIRA View], which is associated with the [EIF Interoperability Level], aggregates the [EIRA Viewpoint] and is a specialization of the [Key Interoperability Enabler] and [Architecture Building Block] which in turn adds granularity to the [Detail - level Architecture Requirement]. The [Detail - level Architecture Requirement] is a specialist ion of the [Interoperability Requirement] which aggregates all the [Interoperability Aspects]. [Analysis of a target digital public solution] is influenced by [Architecture Principle] which is a specialization of the [EIF Principle] and aggregates the [European Library of Architecture Principle]. [Architecture Principle] influences also the [Solution design of a target digital public service / Documentation of an existing digital public service] which is composed by the [EIRA Solution Building Block] that realizes the [Interoperability Specification] and specializes the [Solution Building Block] that, in turn, is composed by the [Digital Solution] which realizes the [Interoperable Digital Solution]. The [Solution Building Block] realizes the [Solution Specification] that is a specialization of the [Interoperability Specification] which aggregates the [EIRA Library of Interoperability Specifications].</documentation>

        <documentation>The Interoperability Governance viewpoint models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that refer to decisions on interoperability frameworks, institutional arrangements, organisational structures, roles and responsibilities, policies, agreements and other aspects of ensuring and monitoring interoperability at national and EU levels. As such, it does not include operational Architecture Building Blocks like interoperability agreements.&#xD;
&#xD;
Interoperability governance is the key to a holistic approach on interoperability, as it brings together all the instruments needed to apply it.&#xD;

Narrative: The selected Architecture Building Blocks from the five different views highlight the Architecture Building Blocks of the EIRA that are related to Interoperability Governance:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the legal view show the [Public Policy Cycle] and the [Legal Interoperability Agreement], which is a specialisation of the [Legal Agreement],&#xD;
&#xD;
2. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the organisational view show that [Data Owner] signs [Organisational Agreement] which is a specialisation of the [Organisational Interoperability Agreement] and is composed by the [Framework Agreement] that is a specialisation of the [Specific Agreement] associated with [Means for Public Policy Objectives Convergence assurance]. The [Interoperability Strategy] implements the [Interoperability Framework], which influences the [Security Framework], the [Privacy Framework], the [Interoperable skill] and the [Interoperability governance]. The [Interoperability Governance] is under the responsibility of the [Interoperability Organisational Authority]. [Delegation of powers provisioning Digital Public Services] influences the [Interoperable Digital Public Service Implementation Orientation] which is realised by the [Digitalisation Roadmap] that realises also the [Digital Agenda], that serves the [Interoperability Strategy]. [Digital Agenda] is associated with [Digital Governance], which, in turn, is associated with [Interoperability Framework], [Security Framework] and [Privacy Framework].&#xD;
&#xD;
3. The selected Architecture Building Block of the semantic view show that [Data Policy] and its specialisation [Descriptive Metadata Policy], [Data Portability Policy], [Open Data Policy], [Master Data Policy], [Base Registry Data Policy] and [Reference Data Policy], together with the [Semantic Interoperability Agreement] are the mainstream of the solution governance at semantic level. Within the [Semantic governance Content] it is also considered that the [Semantic Interoperabilty Agreement] is a specialisation of a [Semantic Agreement].&#xD;
&#xD;
4. The selected Architecture Building Blocks of the technical view show [Technical Interoperability Agreement], which is a specialisation of the [Technical Agreement], which are the mainspring of the solution governance at technical level.</documentation>

        <documentation>The EIRA© API viewpoint models an introductory overview of the focal Architecture Building Blocks required when modelling an API Interface. &#xD;
The ABBs included in the API viewpoint represent all the required Building Block necessary to design an API Interface accessible thoruh a web interface. &#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: &#xD;
A [Client request for service] is made trough [Internet] and it triggers the [Authentication Service] which serves the [Request Validation Service]that triggers the [HTTP(s) Load Balancer] whichin turn triggers all the [Endpoints] related. Each [Endpoint] serves the [Application Service] which triggers the [App Component] that, in turn, triggers the [Data Access Service]. The [Data Access Service] provides access to the [Data Space] which is composed by the [SQL Data Space], [Read - Replica], [NoSQL Data Space] and [Virtual Data Space]. In the moment in which the [Endpoint] is triggered data flows to the [API Response] which is composed by [Data] and [Represenation] accessed by a [Request Validation Service]. The [API Response] triggers the response that is provided to the user who requetd the data in the first instance.</documentation>

Narrative:  &#xD;
&#xD;
[Data] is serialised using [Data Representation] the treatment and contextualisation, drives [Data] and [Data Representation] into [Knowledge]. [Data] can be grouped into [Dataset], as [Dataset] aggregates [Data]. and can be described and aggregated in [Dataset Catalogue]. [Data] is linked to [Ontology], which can be described and aggregated into [Ontologies Catalogue]. [Data Mapping] aggregates [Data] and is described and aggregated into [Data Mapping Catalogue]. [Data Mapping] is also specialised in [Metadata Catalogue], [Data Syntax Mapping Catalogue], and [Software Components Catalogue].  [Distributed Ledger] is associated to [Data] supporting the sharing and recording of encrypted data across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. [Virtual Dataset] aggregates [Dataset], that can be specialised in [Reference Data] and [Master Data]. [Base Registry] is composed of [Master Data]. [Data] can be represented as [Linked Data] and [Open Data], which are specialisations of [Data]. The representation [Linked Open Data] is a specialisation of both [Open Data] and [Linked Data]. [Linked Data] can be distributed by [Linked Open Event Stream], which is a specialisation of it. [Hash Code] and [Metadata] specialise [Data]. [Metadata] is at the same time, specialised by [Data Model], which is composed of [Forms Structure] and [Data Format], and aggregates [Data Syntax]. [Controlled Vocabulary] is a specialisation of [Data Model]. [Data] has a specific [Data Owner] that is responsible for its management, together with [Digital Public Service Delivery Consumer] and [Digital Public Service Delivery Provider Provider] and all negotiate and reach a [Semantic Agreement] and/or a [Semantic Interoperability Agreement], which is a specialisation of [Semantic Agreement]. [Data] is subject to [Data Policy], which has specific cases that are [Master Data Policy], [Security Policy], [Privacy Policy], [Data Portability Policy], and [Open Data Policy].  &#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Semantic Functional content] and [Semantic Governance Content], both are aggregated with [Semantic Knowledge Content]. </documentation>

      <documentation>The Technical - Infrastructure view contains the most salient cross-sectorial infrastructure services that need to be considered to support technical aspects for the infrastructure (i.e. computing hosting, networking, and data hosting) of Digital Solutions regardless the use case considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative:  &#xD;
&#xD;
In the same way, as it happens in the Technical Application view, the [Technical Governance Content], the [Technical Agreement], and its specialisations [Tech Interoperability Agreement] and [Service Level Agreement] constitute the [Technical Governance Content] and influence the whole [Technical Infrastructure Functional Content]. Both, [Technical Governance Content] and [Technical Infrastructure Functional Content] are aggregated by the [Shared Infrastructure Content]. The infrastructure is located in a [Facility Location] and hosted using a [Hosting Facility]. [Hosting Facility] is realised by [Computing Hosting, Networking and Data Hosting Infrastructure]. The capabilities of a [Hosting Facility] are supported by a set of physical (in place) elements: [Physical Computing Infrastructure], [Physical Network Infrastructure], [Physical Communication Infrastructure], [Physical Power Supply Infrastructure] and [Physical Security Infrastructure]. [Analytics Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Analytics Technology Service], [Business Intelligence Technology Service], [Databricks Technology Service], and [Data Catalog Technology Service]. The [Artificial Intelligence infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Machine Learning Technology Service]. [Digital Workplace Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Remote Desktop Technology Service]. [Management Infrastructure Enablers] includes four elements aggregated [Logger Technology Service], [Audit Manager Technology Service], [Telemetry Technology Service] and [Management Console Technology Service]. [Application Integration Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates a set of technology services to facilitate integration in organisations and are [Enterprise Service Bus Technology Service], [Event Manager Technology Service], [API Manager Technology Service], which is aggregated by an [API Gateway Technology Service], also [Serverless Orchestrator Technology Service], [GraphQL Server Technology Service] and [Application Service]. [Content Delivery Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Web Server Technology Service] and [Streaming Server Technology Service]. [Process Orchestration Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Business Process Manager Technology Service]. The [Database Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Relational Database Manager Technology Service], [Object-Oriented Database Manager Technology Service], [NoSQL Database Manager Technology Service], [Graph Database Manager Technology Service], and [Database Cache Manager Technology Service]. [Storage Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [File Storage Technology Service], [Block Storage Technology Service], [Backup Technology Service], and [Distributed File System Technology Service]. [Data Lake Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Data Lake Storage Technology Service]. The [Identity and Access Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Identity Provider Technology Service], [Federated Identity Provider Technology Service], and [Lightweight Directory Access Technology Service]. [Trust Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [PKI Certificate Manager Technology Service]. [Blockchain Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Inmutable Database Manager Technology Service], [Blockchain Ledger Technology Service], and [Distributed Blockchain Network Technology Service]. [Containers Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Container Orchestrator Technology Service] is aggregated by [Containers Manager Technology Service], which is associated to [Container Registry Technology Service], and [Container]. [Networking Infrastructure Enablers] aggregates [Virtual Private Network Technology Service], [Gateway Technology Service], [Domain Name Service Technology Service], and a [Router Technology Service] associated to a [Private Network], composed by a [Private Subnetwork], associated to [Firewall], which is associated to [Load Balancer Technology Service]. [Computing Infrastructure Enablers] is composed with [Virtual Machine] node. [Virtual Machine] specialise a [Server] node. [On Premise Facility] and [Cloud Computing Facility] specialise [Computing Hosting, Networking and Data Hosting Infrastructure]. [On Premise Facility] includes [Local Area Network]. [Cloud Computing Facility] is associated with [SaaS], which is composed of [PaaS], and [PaaS] is composed of [IaaS]. The [IaaS] includes [Cloud Private Network]. [Hybrid Cloud Facility] and [Edge Computing] aggregate both [On Premise Facility], and [Cloud Computing Facility]. Also, [On Premise Facility] and [Cloud Computing Facility] are served by [Wide Area Networking], which aggregates [Secure Public Network], specialised by [Public Network]. [Additional Area Networking] includes several associations that can be established with external services, facilities or devices, for instance [External Facility], [External Service], [Desktop Computer], [Smart Device], [Sensor], [Remote Desktop Client]. &#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Technical Infrastructure Functional content] and [Technical Governance content]. The Architecture Building Blocks defined can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, of which the [Solution Specification] is a specialization. </documentation>

      <documentation>The Technical - Application Domain specific view contains the most salient application Architecture Building Blocks that need to be considered to support technical aspects for the End-to-End analysis and design of Digital Solutions. A Digital Solution can support one or more public policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative:  &#xD;
&#xD;
[Interoperable Digital Solution] aggregates [Shared Platform], and provides access to data and services. The [Interoperable Digital Solution] includes [Machine to Machine Interface] with [Human Interface], which both realise [Digital Public Service Delivery], which assign [Digital Public Service], which realize [Digital Business Capability]. Also [Machine to Machine Interface] and [Human Interface] assign [Digital Solution Service] which is realised by [Digital Solution Component]. [Interoperable Digital Solution] is influenced by [Technical Agreement], and its specialisation [Tech Interoperability Agreement] and [Service Level Agreement], all three elements constitute [Technical Governance Content].   &#xD;
&#xD;
[Shared Platform] includes [API Enablers] to register the system services in which [Web Service] which is a specialisation of [API], as well as [Machine to Machine Interface]. [API Catalogue Component] realises [API Discovery and Catalogue Service] which associate with [API Catalogue] which associate with [API]. [Service Registry] is associate with (is a) [Web Service] and [Service Discovery and Registry Service] which realized by [Service Registry Component]. Orchestration Enablers in which [Orchestration Component] realises [Orchestration Service]. Security Enablers in which [Audit Component] realises [Audit Service]. [Security Enablers] include a subset of Identification and Access Enablers where [Identification Component] realises [Authentication Service], [Request Validation Service], [Registration Service], and [Access Management Component] realises [Access Management Service] and its specialisations [Identity Management Service], [Authorisation Service], and the [Accounting Service]. [Test Enablers] in which [Conformance Testing Component] accesses [Conformance Test Scenario] and performs [Conformance Testing Service]. Trust between systems is established with Identity management is realised with [Trust Enablers] in which [Trust Service Provisioning Component] realises [e-Signature Creation Service],[e-signature Verification and Validation Service],[e-signature Preservation Service], [e-Seal Creation Service], [e-Seal Verification and Validation Service], [e-Seal Preservation Service], [e-Timestamp Creation Service], [e-Timestamp Verification and Validation Service], [Registered Electronic Delivery Service] and [Integrity Verification Service]. Also [Blockchain Component] realises [Blockchain Service]. In [Data Exchange Enablers] exist [Data Exchange Component] which realises [Data Exchange Service]. In [Data Management Enablers] exist the [Metadata Management Component] realises [Metadata Management Service]. [e-Archiving Component] realises [e-Archiving Service]. [Data Management Component] realises [Data Management Service]. [Forms Management Component] realises [Content Management Service] and [Forms Management Service]. [Data Publication Component] realises [Data Publication Service]. [Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading Component] realises [Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading Service]. [Data Quality Component] realises [Data Quality Service]. [Data Persistence Component] realises [Data Persistence Service]. There is also the [Data Virtualization Component] that realises [Data Virtualization Service]. In [Privacy Enablers] exists the [Privacy Component], which realises the [Privacy Service]. In [Knowledge Discovery Enablers] the [Knowledge Discovery Component] realises [Knowledge Discovery Component Service] which is associated with [Knowledge Triple stone]. In [Analytics Enablers] [Data Analytics Component] realises [Data Analytics Service]. In [Artificial Intelligence] the [Artificial Intelligent Component] realises [Artificial Intelligent Service]. [Translation Enablers] enable the possibility to increase the accessibility to public service through [Machine Translation Component] that realises [Machine Translation Service]. In [Users Experience Management Enablers] the [Public Administration Single Window Component] realises [Public Administration Single Window Service]. In [Digital Workplace Enablers] exist [Digital Workplace Component] which realises [Digital Workplace Service]. In [Schedule Management Enablers] the [Schedule Management Component] realises [Schedule Management Service], and the [Agenda Management Component] realises [Agenda Management Service], which is a specialisation of [Schedule Management Service]. The [Data Space Enablers] includes the [Data Space] which aggregates [Data Space Connector], and it has two specialisations, which are the [Data Space Connector Provider] and [Data Space Connector Consumer].   &#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Technical Application Functional content] and [Technical Application Governance content] &#xD;
&#xD;
The Architecture Building Blocks defined in the [Digital Solution] can have [Interoperability Specification] associated, which is a specialisation of [Solution Specification] and realises [Interoperability Requirement]. </documentation>

      <documentation>The Legal view models the most salient public policy development enablers and implementation instruments that shall be considered to support the End-to-End design of interoperable digital public services. &#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative: &#xD;
&#xD;
A [Public Policy] aims at addressing the needs of a group of stakeholders, and it is associated with a [Public Policy Objective]. The policy is formulated and realized with the help of [Legal Act] which has two specializations [European Legal Act] and [National Legal Act] in the form of [Binding Instrument] or [Non-Binding Instrument]. A key type of legislation for behavioural interoperability is the [Legislation on Data Information and Knowledge Exchange], which is a specialization of a legal key enabler for the delivery of digital public services, the [Legislation on Digital Public Services]. Both are contained in [Legislation Catalogue], as they are specialisations. [Legislation Catalogue] include [Legal Act] and the different specialisations [European Legal Act] and [National Legal Act], and the different forms [Binding Instrument], and [Non-Binding Instrument]. The [Legal act] aggregates [Legal Clauses] and is realised by [Public Policy] and linked to the [Granularity of Legal Requirements]. [Public Policy] realises [Digital-ready Policymaking], and the same time [Public Policy Constraint] which is a specialisation of a [Public Policy Context] realises the [Public Policy]. [Public Policy] has associated a [Public Policy Objective] and [Delegation of Powers Provisioning Digital Public Services], which influences [Public Policy Context]. As part of the Legal Governance Content, [Legal Agreement] is specialised by [Legal Interoperability Agreement] focused on formalizing governance rules enabling collaboration between digital public services. [Legal Interoperability Agreement] can be reached at the European level [European Legal Interoperability Agreement] or the National level [National Legal Interoperability Agreement].  &#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Legal Governance Content] and the [Legal Functional Content], which both are aggregated by [Shared Legal Content].</documentation>

      <documentation>The Organisational view models the most salient Architecture Building Blocks that shall be considered to support organisational aspects for the End-to-End design of Digital Public Services.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Narrative:  &#xD;
&#xD;
[Digital Public Service] is delivered according to its [Digital Public Service Delivery Model] and realises a [Digital Business Capability] by accessing [Information]. [Digital Public Service] is documented in [Digital Public Service Catalogue] that can be used among others with services portfolio management purposes. The [Digital Public Service Catalogue] aggregates the [Shared Organisational Content] as the [Organisational Agreement] and the [Digital Public Service Delivery Model]. [Digital Public Service Delivery Model] assigns/aggregates [Digital Public Service Delivery Machine Agent] and [Digital Public Service Delivery Human Agent] both serving a role [Agent]. [Agent] is specialised by stakeholders [Individual] and [Legal Entity], which is the specialisation of another stakeholder [Organisation]. [Organisation] is also specialised by stakeholders such as [Business] and [Public Administration]. An [Agent] can serve both relations, as [Digital Public Service Consumer] and [Digital Public Service Provider]. Both roles are assigned with the business function [Digital Public Service Provision]. [Organisational Agreement], which is specialised in [Organisational Interoperability Agreement]. [Digital Governance Plan] is composed by contracts [Agreement on Provision of Digital Public Services], [Agreement on Interoperability Security] which is associated to [Security Framework], the [Agreement on Privacy] associated to [Privacy Framework], the [Agreement on Data Sharing] and [Agreement of the Use on Common Infrastructure] both associated to [Interoperability Framework]. [Digital Governance Plan] realises the [Digital Agenda] that influences the [Interoperability Strategy]. [Digital Agenda] is realised by a [Digitalisation Roadmap], which developing the constraint [Interoperable Digital Public Service Implementation Orientation]. [Data Owner] is a business role that signs or agrees upon [Organisational Agreement] that realises the constraint [Means for Public Policy Objectives Convergence Assurance and Control]. On the delivery of the [Digital Public Service] a [Digital Public Service Delivery] business interface is assigned to the [Digital Public Service], and the business interface can have different modalities such as [Web App], [Mobile App], [Desktop App], [Service App], and [Adaptive Configuration].  &#xD;
&#xD;
These different Architecture Building Blocks define the [Organisational Governance content] and [Organisational Functional content], both aggregated with [Shared Organisational Content]. Each of these Architecture Building Blocks can have any [Interoperability Specification] associated, which is realised by a [Solution Building Block]. </documentation>

  <purpose>This file provides the ArchiMate model of the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA). The EIRA has been developed in the context of Action of the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA2) Programme. The EIRA is a reference architecture focused on the End to End design of interoperable digital public service. It is composed of the most important architecture building blocks needed for the delivery of digital public services, realise digital business capabilties for public administrations and promote cross-border and cross-sector interactions between public administrations. The EIRA is a Service Oriented Architecture and uses ArchiMate as a modelling notation. The EIRA implements the New European Interoperability Framework (EIF). 

The latest release of the EIRA is available on Joinup: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/eia/description 
The latest release of the new EIF is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en</purpose>
