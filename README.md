## In a nutshell
Here are the recommended ways (tool-agnostic!) to contribute to this repo:
  * always create a pull request to commit changes, even if the assignee is yourself;
  * do not alter the model directory manually, it's operated by the coArchi plugin and any manual alteration would most likely break it.
  
## In a nutbasket

The toolbox we use:

  * GitHub Desktop: https://youtu.be/S7f8qJscmRE
  * Archi&coArchi: https://youtu.be/Ht1Bf7VXfkk
  For Windows users, the most convenient Archi installation would be the portable ZIP (make sure you download the correct architecture, e.g. x64). The screenshot below shows proven to work versions of Archi (4.6.0) and coArchi (0.5.4.202002281020).
