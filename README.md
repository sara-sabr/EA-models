## In a nutshell
Here are the recommended ways (tool-agnostic!) to contribute to this repo:
  * always create a pull request to commit changes, even if the assignee is yourself;
  * do not alter the model directory manually, it's operated by the coArchi plugin and any manual alteration would most likely break it.
